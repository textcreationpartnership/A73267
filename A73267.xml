            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As in theſe reſpects I was the bolder to dedicate theſe my labors to your Honors and Worſhips, ſo not fearing any imputation of preſumption, I thought it more fit to dedicat the ſame to you all generally, then to any one, or to ſome few particularly, that ſo none might think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe excluded, and that euery one might accept them as dedicated to himſelfe, and ſo vouchſafe to read them the more diligently, and to make the better vſe of them, according to his place.</p>
            <p>The rather alſo did I take incouragement ſo to doe, that yee eſpecially might by theſe my labors the more cleerly ſee, that without this dignity in this treatiſe ſet ſorth, and the right vſe of the ſame, all nobility, honor, and dignity in this world is of no value, of no price, of no account.</p>
            <p>As <hi>age is a crowne of glory, being found in the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 31.</note> and no otherwiſe; ſo may it be ſaid of nobility, and of all other dignities of the world. The deſcription <hi>of the ſonnes of Nobles by eating in time for ſtrength, and not for drunkenneſſe:</hi> (this ſobriety in eating and drinking for <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10. 17.</note> the rareneſſe of it in great perſons of the world, being
<pb facs="tcp:18428:3"/> ſynecdochically put for all vertues) This deſcription (I ſay) <hi>of the ſonnes of nobles,</hi> doth plainly teach them only to be truly worthy of the ſaid honorable title, which by the foreſaid vertue and all other accompanying the ſame, do ſhew themſelues to be the children of God.</p>
            <p>Doth not the ſame <hi>Salomon</hi> alſo ſay without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any degree in the world, that <hi>the righteous is more</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 12. 26.</note> 
               <hi>excellent then his neighbor?</hi> Elſewhere alſo he preferreth (not a great name, but) <hi>a good name aboue great riches, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 1. Ecceſ. 7. 3.</note> 
               <hi>before precious ointment:</hi> both which commonly are apur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances and ornaments of nobility, and other worldly dignity. What is a good name, but ſuch a name as is gotten by doing of thoſe things, which belong to the children of God?</p>
            <p>The former point is further euident by diuers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. For all honor and dignity according to this world, is only in this world. But the dignity of being the ſennes of the moſt High, is alſo in heauen. For ye ſhal afterward ſee in the treatiſe, that the children of God doe <hi>ſit with Chriſt Ieſus in the heavenly places,</hi> euen while they are here in the earth. All worldly honors and dignities doe end with this life. For as <hi>in the reſurrection, men ſhall neither marry wiues, nor women ſhall be giuen in mariage;</hi> ſo then <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 30.</note> there ſhall be neither Gentlemen, nor Eſquires, nor Knights, nor Barons, nor any ſuch degree of men, but all ſhall be as one in Chriſt Ieſus. But the dignity of the children of God after this life is inlarged, and in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ſhall be made greater then it was. Euen then (I ſay) ſhall the dignity of adoption be increaſed, when all worldly dignity ſhall be vtterly ceaſed.</p>
            <p>As men are noble, honorable, or worſhipfull in this world, they are but in fauor with men; but as they be the children of God, they are in grace with God himſelfe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:18428:4"/>
            <p>Worldly dignity doth but giue acceſſe to worldlie Princes: but the dignity of adoption, hath acceſſe (with aſſurance of preuailing) to the throne of him that is Lord of heauen, and earth.</p>
            <p>As here men are Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earles, Vicounts, Barons, &amp;c. they haue but men to attend vpon them: but the treatiſe following will ſhew, that as any bee the children of God, the glorious Angels of heauen do wait vpon them, and continually guard them for their ſafety, and further good.</p>
            <p>As here men be in great place, they haue but earthlie inheritances, whereof they or theirs may be diſpoſſeſſed and cleane diſinherited: But as they bee the children of God, they haue an inheritance in heauen, far paſſing all the kingdomes of the world, and the which all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of hell ſhall neuer take away.</p>
            <p>Many other the like prerogatiues ſhall ye find in this treatiſe, of the children of the Almighty in heauen, far excelling the honors of <hi>the ſons of the mighty in earth:</hi> Of the which prerogatiues I do here giue you but this taſt, thereby the more to quicken your appetite, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to incourage you to vouchſafe the reading of thoſe more largely handled, and of many other contained in the treatiſe it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Pleaſeth it your Honors and worſhips further to ſee the former point in the glaſſe of a few examples? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then (I beſeech you) <hi>Moſes, Ioſhua, Othniel, Ehud, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah, Gideon, I phtah, Sampſon,</hi> and all the other good Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Iſrael, before the kingdome of Iſrael eſtabliſhed. For were they ſo honourable by being kings fellowes, and hauing kingly authority, as they were by doing thoſe things which teſtified their adoption? Behold <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> (two mighty kings of al Iſrael) with <hi>Aſa,
<pb facs="tcp:18428:4"/> Iehoſhaphat, Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> all good Kings of <hi>Iuda.</hi> For were theſe ſo honorable by being great and mighty princes, as they were by being the children of God? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>Eſter, Mordecai, Shadrach, Meſhach, Abednego,</hi> and <hi>Daniel.</hi> For were they ſo honorable, the one by being a Queene, and the wife of a moſt mighty monarch, that had 127. prouinces vnder him, the other by beeing in great grace &amp; fauor with the like mighty monarchs; as they were by ſhewing themſelues the children of God? Yea, behold <hi>Cyrus, Artaſhaſht, Darius</hi> and <hi>Ahaſbueroſh,</hi> all heathen Emperors. For were they ſo honorable by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Emperors (though ſome of them had 127. pro. uinces vnder their gouernment) as they were by doing ſome things for the Church and people of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they did only reſemble Gods children, and were not ſo indeed? May not the like be ſaid of <hi>Iehu</hi> King of Iſrael? For was he ſo honorable by being King of Iſrael, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily annointed ſo to bee by the appointment of God; as he was by his zeale (though only temporary) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Baal,</hi> and his Prieſts and ſeruants?

For what is this, but for the excuſe of your wauering mind to lie of the holy ghoſt? And how much leſſe ſinne is this lying of the holy Ghoſt,
<pb facs="tcp:18428:11"/> then that of</hi> Ananias and Sapphira of lying to the holie ghoſt. <hi>Acts. 5. 3. I may amplifie this point, by that which is written in the law, againſt him that</hi> ſinned againſt the Lord, in denying vnto his neighbour that which was taken him to keepe, or that which was put to him of truſt: <hi>Leuit. 6. 2. For if it be ſo great a ſinne againſt the Lord for a man</hi> to deny vnto his neighbour that which was taken him to keepe, or that which was put to him of truſt, <hi>to be reſtored againe to the owner, without any benefit to the keeper; oh then, how heinous a ſinne is it againſt the Lord, to deny the free gift of God himſelfe, beſtowed vpon wretched man, neuer to be reſtored, but to continue to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concerning ſuch as are already ſeparated from amongſt you, and do ſo continue, if they haue made ſeparation onely in zeale which is not according to knowledge, without pride, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, and contempt againſt all other, ſuch I wiſh, well and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to conſider the words and counſell of the angell which found out</hi> Hagar <hi>being fled from her miſtris</hi> Sara, <hi>for her hard dealing with her. For as the Angell firſt asked her</hi> whence ſhe came, and whither ſhe would goe: <hi>and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly vpon her anſwere, that</hi> ſhe fled from her dame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, <hi>commanded her</hi> to returne to her dame, and to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her ſelfe vnder her hands: <hi>Geneſ. 16. 7. ſo, and much more, let the ſeparatiſts among you conſider the more</hi> whence they came, and whither they are going: <hi>as alſo to make the more haſt of</hi> returning and humbling themſelues <hi>to them whom without ſufficient cauſe they haue for ſaken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their regeneration (if they be regenerated) receiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and wrought by ſome of them whom they haue for ſaken, is a farre greater benefit, then all that euer</hi> Hagar <hi>had had at the hands of her miſtris</hi> Sara. <hi>Touching both the that are ſeparated, and alſo that are not, I do iointly intreat
<pb facs="tcp:18428:11"/> them with iudgement to conſider, firſt the ſpeedy growth of them that decline that way like to the gourd of Iona:</hi> Iona. 4. 6. <hi>not like to the</hi> graine of muſtard ſeede, <hi>whereunto the kingdome of heauen is compared:</hi> Mat. 13. 31. <hi>which at the firſt being the leaſt of all ſeedes, afterward groweth (not of the ſudden, but) by degrees to be a great tree. For may not this make them to ſuſpect their courſe to be rather according to nature, then according to grace? Is it not more eaſie to goe downe the hill, then vp the hill?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The rather may this ſudden growth be ſuſpected, becauſe it is more without meanes in one day, or at leaſt by ſmall and ſimple meanes, onely by priuate talking, &amp;c. then before they did</hi> grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>in many moneths. Great indeede was the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ſucceſſe of the ſermon of Peter:</hi> Acts. 2. 41. <hi>and of the preaching of Paul to the keeper of the priſon. Acts.</hi> 16. 33.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, alas, the extraordinary and ſtrange meanes before mentioned in either place, doe ſhew not onely the ſaid ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and great ſucceſſe to haue beene extraordinary, but alſo that the like extraordinary ſucceſſe requireth more extra ordinary means, then in theſe dais we haue warrant to expect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, let both ſorts before mentioned further conſider, the ſcoffing, gibing, and contemptuous ſpirit (I ſpeake this with griefe) of moſt of them that are ſeparated, againſt all other, eſpecially not inclining towards them: moſt of all againſt them that haue done them moſt good, if euer they haue at all</hi> taſted <hi>(in truth)</hi> how good the Lord is, 1. <hi>Pet. 2. 2. Is the ſpirit of God the ſpirit of ſcoffing, gibing, and contempt? No: but of ſobrietie, of grauitie, of meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and of reuerence, teaching them in whom it is,</hi> not to be high minded, but to make themſelues <hi>(though of high place)</hi> equall to them of the lower ſort: <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 16. and in meekenes of minde, to eſteem other better then themſelues. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:18428:12"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, let both ſorts before ſpoken vnto, further yet obſerue, the ignorance of many that are moſt prone to ſeparation, in the things of greateſt moment, and of moſt neceſſity; and alſo what little conſcience they make of ſactifying the Lords day, not only not ſpending the time of their abſence from our aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in priuate exerciſes of religion at home, but alſo in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp and downe idlely in the fields &amp; woods, &amp;c: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how they neglect their callings, and misſpend their time in running vp and down to talke one with another of ſeparation, and ſo waſt that little ſtocke which before through the good bleſſing of God they had gotten, whiles they did diligently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their calling.

                  <p>Of the ſpeciall reaſon of writing this Treatiſe. Of the Text of Scripture generally whereupon the ſame is grounded.

               <p>I am not ignorant that ſome things by diuers learned, godly, and reuerend men, haue beene written pertaining to this theame. <hi>Peter de La Place,</hi> a noble man (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) of <hi>France,</hi> at leaſt a worthy Chriſtian, and deſcribed by the name of <hi>one of the Kings Counſell, and chiefe Preſident of his Court of Aids in Paris,</hi> hath written a godly Treatiſe in <hi>French, Of the excellencie of a Chriſtian:</hi> which is alſo tranſlated into Engliſh, and printed 1576.</p>
               <p>In that worthy worke alſo of M. <hi>Rogers,</hi> publiſhed about ſome fiue yeeres ſithence, there is one treatiſe <hi>(viz.</hi> the ſixt) wholly of the priuileges of a Chriſtian: which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment differeth not much from this preſent theame, <hi>Of the dignitie of Gods children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Otho Caſmannus</hi> likewiſe a very learned and godlie man, hath written more lately two bookes in Latine, one intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Hominis ſpiritualis anatomia &amp; meditatio, &amp;c. The ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie and meditation of a ſpirituall man,</hi> printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1605. the other intituled, <hi>Chriſtianus nomine &amp; re, &amp;c.

               <p>Notwithſtanding, becauſe the firſt of theſe <hi>(Peter de La

Againe, becauſe <hi>M. Rogers</hi> his treatiſe of the priuileges of a Chriſtian, being a part of his great booke, neuer ſeparated from his other ſix treatiſes therein contained, is not therefore euery mans money: beſides, becauſe it goeth vnder another title, and doth handle but ſome part of the matter of this treatiſe: and laſtly, becauſe the two workes of <hi>Caſmannus</hi> are only in Latine, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not fit for common Engliſhmen, ignorant of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongue: and becauſe they are written in ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, as euery one vnderſtanding the Latine tongue, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well conceiue the ſame; therefore, notwithſtanding all thoſe ſaid workes, I haue thought it worthy the labour to write more largely of the dignity of Gods children, then either <hi>Peter de La Place,</hi> or <hi>M.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe three verſes, two things are conteined. The firſt is the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Gods children. The ſecond is the dutie of them. Touching the former, let vs obſerue: firſt, the coherence of the Apoſtles words, concerning the dignity of Gods children, with that which before he had ſaid in the end of the former Chapter: as alſo the reaſon of the ſaid words in reſpect of the matter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the reſt of this Epiſtle: Secondly, let vs conſider the preſent words of the Apoſtle, touching the foreſaid dignity, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Touching the coherence of theſe words with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it is this:</p>
                  <p>In the 28. verſe of the former Chapter, the Apoſtle had exhorted theſe Chriſtians to whom he writeth, vnto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, ſaying, <hi>And now little children abide in him,</hi> meaning Chriſt. This exhortation he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by an argument taken from the end in the very ſame verſe, <hi>viz. That when hee ſhall appeare they might be bold.</hi> This end he illuſtrateth by the contrary in the next words, adding, <hi>and not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before him at his comming.</hi> In the 29. verſe he had alſo confirmed the ſame end, by an argument taken from an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18428:17"/> adiunct or attribute of them that <hi>abide in Chriſt.</hi> Which alſo he laieth foorth not barely or nakedly, but (as it were) cloathed with an argument from their owne knowledge, or teſtimonie, in theſe words: <hi>If ye know that he is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, know yee that he that doth righteouſly is borne of him.</hi> In which argument let vs obſerue, that hee doth not ſay (as <note place="margin">Note.</note> before) <hi>he that abideth in him,</hi> but that changing the words he ſaith, <hi>he that doth righteouſly, is borne of him.</hi> Wherefore is this change of words? To teach, that when he had before exhorted them <hi>to abide in him,</hi> his meaning was not, that they ſhould be conſtant only touching their ſound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not embracing any errours contrary to the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome doctrine of Chriſt before heard and learned by them; but alſo that they ſhould be conſtant in all holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous liuing, agreeable to ſuch conſtancie in ſound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Paul</hi> ioineth conſtancie in iudgement, and in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of life, together, 1. <hi>Cor. 15. 58. Therefore my beloued brethren, be ſtedfaſt and vnremooueable,</hi> (ſee heere the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of iudgement or minde) <hi>abounding alwaies in the workes of the Lord.</hi> See heere alſo, conſtancie in practiſe and true <hi>godlineſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, let vs obſerue, in the former argument and in that 29. <hi>ver.</hi> that the Apoſtle doth not <hi>ſay euery one that doth righteous things is borne of God;</hi> but <hi>unto euery one that doth righteouſly.</hi> For the wicked and reprobate (as <hi>Saul, Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Horod, &amp;c.)</hi> doe many righteous things, but the children of God and the elect doe onely righteouſly.</p>
                  <p>Thridly, let vs obſerue in the ſaid verſe, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith not, <hi>euery one that doth righteouſly is the child of God;</hi> but <hi>euery one that doth righteouſly is borne of God.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he teacheth that he ſpeaketh not of them that are the children of God by creation of their ſubſtances, but of them that are the children of God by regeneration, and by that new birth, where of our Sauiour ſpeaketh to <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Iohn 3. 3. Except a man be borne againe, he cannot ſee the kingdome of God:</hi> and againe, <hi>Except a man bee borne of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18428:18"/> water &amp; of the ſpirit, hee cannot enter into the kingdome of God:</hi> verſ. 5. By creation of ſubſtance the wicked and reprobate, yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the diuels themſelues are the children of God, but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lect onely are the children of God by regeneration.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, in that he ſimply ſaith not, <hi>Euery one that doth righteouſly is borne of God,</hi> but fortifieth the ſame by their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> teſtimony and knowledge: hee thereby teacheth, that the worke of regeneration is not a matter of doubtfull coniecture, but of certaine knowledge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ea, fiftly, in that hee ſtrengthneth all this by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument called by the Logicians, <hi>a coniugatis,</hi> or from the like attribute in God, to that wherof he ſpeaketh touching them that are borne of God, ſaying, <hi>If yee know that he is righteous know ye that he that doth righteouſly, is borne of God.</hi> Thereby he further teacheth the foreſaid certainty of their regeneration, <hi>viz.</hi> that as certainly as they know God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be righteous, ſo certainly they might aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that <hi>Euery one</hi> (without exception of any) <hi>that doth righteouſly is borne of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He teacheth moreouer, that there is no other way, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to declare our ſelues the children of God, then by doing righteouſly as he himſelfe is righteous. No naturall child of man doth more declare himſelfe to be the child of him whoſe child indeed he is, by any ſimilitude of perſon or of behauiour, then they that doe righteouſly, doe ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be children of God. One man may be like another in perſon, and in behauiour, that is of no kindred to him to whom he is like. But it is impoſſible that any ſhould doe righteouſly, but he that is the childe of the righteous God: or that any ſhould be the child of the righteous God, but hee that doth righteouſly. <hi>If God were your Father</hi> ſaith our Sauiour to the Iewes) <hi>then would ye loue me, Iohn</hi> 8. 48. And <hi>If yee loue me, then</hi> (ſaith he againe) <hi>keepe my Commandements, Iohn</hi> 14. 15. What is the keeping of his Commandements but <hi>to doe righteouſly?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From theſe things hitherto noted of the certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">Note.</note> of regeneration, and of being borne of God, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18428:18"/> alſo another point, <hi>viz.</hi> of the certaintie of the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſuch as are ſo borne of God, with boldneſſe without all feare of any ſhame before him at his appearing: Doe not all theſe things make much for that dignitie of the children of God, for the writing whereof, wee haue inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this preſent treatiſe? But of theſe things more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time by all hitherto ſaid, wee ſee how the Apoſtle in the former Chapter hath come to the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our being the children of God, and that this is the very laſt point handled in the former chapter. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a point of great moment, and yet for the moſt part too lightly regarded, yea ſearcely ſo much as once looked vpon, therefore in the beginning of this chapter hee inſiſteth vpon it, and commendeth it to their further conſideration, as a matter very excellent and admirable, and in no caſe to be too ſlenderly paſſed ouer, but worthy all diligent obſeruation and making. Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Behold what loue the Father hath giuen vnto vs, that we ſhould be called his children.</hi> This is the plaine cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of theſe words with the end of the former Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Touching the reaſon of them in reſpect of the chiefe matter following in the reſt of this Epiſtle, eſpecially in this Chapter and in the next, that is likewiſe plaine and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident. For the Apoſtle being afterward to exhort theſe Chriſtians to mutuall brotherly loue, that is, to the loue of the children of God, what better foundation could hee lay for the ſaid exhortation, then a graue admonition, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to conſider the dignity of Gods children, and the vnſpeakable, yea the admirable loue of God towards them in aduancing them to the ſaid dignitie? For ſo the Apoſtle in this preface, and graue exhortation to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods loue, in making men his children, laieth two maine arguments for the better prouoking of men to the loue of Gods children: one from the example of Gods loue towards them in making them his children: this being farre more then all other can doe for them: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18428:19"/> from the excellencie of them that are ſo made his children. For ought not all to loue them whom God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth? eſpecially whom he ſo loueth, as to make them his children? The more excellent alſo that any bee, are they not the more worthy of the loue of all other?</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the coherence of theſe words with the former; as alſo for the reaſon of them in reſpect of the matter following.</p>
                  <p>Now to come to the preſent words of the Apoſtle: they are (as partly we haue ſeene) a graue exhortation to the ſerious conſideration of the loue of God in making men his children by the worke of regeneration, touched in the laſt verſe of the former chapter. For how excellent ſoeuer this loue of God be, yet the Apoſtle ſeeing the ſame to bee made a matter of nothing in the world, neither the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God to be eſteemed according to their excellency, but rather to be deſpiſed and contemned, doth therefore commend that which before he had touched, to their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration, preuenting alſo an obiection touching their contempt in the world, and ſhewing the reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to be, partly becauſe the world knoweth not God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and partly becauſe the future ſtate and condition of Gods children is not ſo apparent to the world as it is to themſelues. From hence he taketh occaſion to ſet foorth their future excellencie and happineſſe, (whatſoeuer their preſent baſeneſſe and miſerie ſeeme to bee) and laſt of all ſheweth what vſe they are to make in the meane time of their hope of the ſaid future excellencie and happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>This briefly is the ſumme of all theſe three firſt verſes of this Chapter: viz. that in them is contained (as firſt I ſaid) both the excellencie of the children of God, and alſo their duty according to their ſaid excellencie.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeake more particularly of theſe words, concerning the former of theſe two points, let vs obſerue theſe two things: viz.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The exhortation it ſelfe to the ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the excellencie of Gods children.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:18428:19"/>2. The preuenting of an obiection that might haue beene made againſt the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The exhortation is in theſe words: <hi>Behold what loue the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath giuen vnto vs, that wee ſhould be called the ſonnes of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The preuenting of the obiection is in the words following, both in that verſe, and alſo in the ſecond. Then in the third verſe followeth the dutie of the children of God, by occaſion of the ſecond part of his anſwer to the former obiection.</p>
                  <p>To returne to the exhortation, let vs firſt of all note, and <note place="margin">Note.</note> but note this one thing: namely, that as in other places of Scripture the holy Ghoſt commendeth the loue of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, in making his owne Sonne to bee the ſonne of man for vs; ſo heere hee commendeth his loue towards vs, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vs, that are but men, to be the ſonnes of God. As in other places we are taught, that the ſonne of God was made alſo the ſonne of man; ſo heere we are taught, that the ſonnes of men are alſo made the ſonnes of God: and this he doth, the better (as was before noted) to prouoke them afterward to the loue of them, whom God ſo loueth, as to make them his children: for it cannot be, but that the more men doe conſider of the loue of God towards themſelues and other in making them his children, the more they ſhould be prouoked to loue them whom God hath loued, and made his children as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
                  <p>To returne againe to the preſent exhortation, let vs firſt briefly conſider the words thereof particularly, and then more largely lay foorth the thing it ſelfe (that is, the dignitie of Gods children) heere ſpecially commended to our behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The words vſed by the Apoſtle are euery one very em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticall and ſignificant, and ſuch as doe import the dignitie of Gods children to be very great.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Behold]</hi> The firſt word, <hi>Behold,</hi> is a note of attention, or of exhortation to the moſt diligent marking and obſeruing of that which followeth. It is often vſed in the Scripture, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed before matters of great moment and importance, that by the hearers or readers they may the better bee noted and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. <hi>Pſal. 77. 5. Come and behold the workes of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal. 133. 1. Behold how good and how comely a thing it is, brethren, to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18428:20"/> dwell euen together. Pſal. 134. 1. Behold, praiſe ye the Lord all ye ſeruants of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ioh. 1. 29. Behold the Lambe of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luc. 19. 8. And Zacheus ſtood foorth, and ſaid vnto the Lord, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Lord, the halfe of my goods I giue to the poore,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom. 11. 22. Behold therefore the bountifulneſſe and ſeuerity of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe, and diuers other the like places, the word <hi>Behold</hi> is vſed to prouoke men diligently to note and marke, and not to looke as it were aſquint, or glauncingly to caſt one eie aſide at a thing, but with both eies to take a view of that which is commended vnto vs: yea, not only to marke with the eies of our body, but alſo to note with the eies of our minde. For it is all one with the word <hi>Conſider: 1. Sam. 12. 24. Conſider how great things the Lord hath done for you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Oh conſider this ye that forget God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 22.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in ſome places the holy Ghoſt is not content with the word <hi>Behold</hi> alone, but he ioineth another therewith of like ſignification, euen the word <hi>ſee,</hi> to excite and awaken men to the more ſerious conſideration of the matter ſpoken of: as <hi>Lament.</hi> 1. 12. to mooue all men the more diligently to marke the wofull ſtate of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the Prophet ſpeaking in the perſon of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Behold and ſee, if there bee any ſorrow like vnto my ſorrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is alſo a vſuall thing with vs, when we thinke men do not well conſider any ware, or other benefit offred vnto them, to ſay thus, I pray ſee it, I pray you behold it, &amp;c. This then is it that the Apoſtle ſignifieth and requireth by this word, in the firſt place, that men ſhould diligently note, marke, obſerue, and conſider, the loue of God towards other men, &amp; towards themſelues, in making them his children; and that, as a matter of great worth and excellencie.</p>
                  <p>Yea, the Apoſtle inſinuateth by this word, that although the dignitie and honourable ſtate of Gods children be very great, yet men are too ſecure and negligent in beholding the ſame, except they bee rouſed vp and awakened, and (in a manner) cried vnto (as men in a dead ſleepe, yea, as Chriſt cried with a loud voice to <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the graue) to behold it.</p>
                  <p>If it were not ſo, the Apoſtle would haue reſted &amp; contented himſelfe in that mention which he had made of our being the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18428:20"/> children of God, in the end of the former chapter. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſaw that men for the moſt part were heerein aſleepe, therefore concerning this matter, hee ſpeaketh vnto them as another Apoſtle ſpeaketh in another matter, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand vp from the dead, Epheſ</hi> 5. 14. and ſaith heere, <hi>Behold what loue the Father hath giuen vnto vs, that wee ſhould be called his children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching earthly dignities and prerogatiues, we are wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enough. Our eies are alwaies both broad open, and euer poring into them, ſo that wee need not be bidden to behold: for wee ſee and behold too much. Or if at any time wee fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe touching this matter, yet wee are halfe awake, and the leaſt whiſpering that is of any worldly preferment, will make vs ſtart vp, and ſtand vpon both our legges, and looke round about vs, and ouer euery mans head, (though taller then our ſelues by the head) not only to looke vpon it, but alſo to looke after it, and (if poſſibly we can by hooke or crooke) to get it, euen from them that are ten times more worthy of it then our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>Yea, ſo much doe wee looke vpon and after ſuch matters, that either we haue neuer an eie to behold this dignity of Gods children, or any ſuch ſpirituall matter; or elſe we ſee but weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and dimlie, as men halfe aſleepe and halfe awake: yea, as men halfe blind and halfe ſeeing: and as the blinde man, whoſe eies our Sauiour had begunne to open, and who ſaid, <hi>I ſee men walking like trees, Marc.</hi> 8. 24. In this reſpect therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth the rather heere ſay, <hi>Behold what loue,</hi> &amp;c. And becauſe this heere ſpoken of, is of another nature then the things of this world, and of this life, and becauſe of our ſelues naturally, we are all blinde, <hi>ſitting in darkneſſe and in the ſhadow of death, Luc. 1. 79. Act.</hi> 26. 18. and becauſe ſuch of vs as haue the eies of our <hi>vnderſtanding lightned,</hi> haue them not ſo light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but that we <hi>ſee only in part,</hi> and as it were with ſpectacles thorow a glaſſe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. ſo that ſtill we had need to pray our ſelues, and to bee praied for by other, <hi>that the eies of our vnderſtanding may bee further lightned, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 18. and this weakneſſe of ſight in our inward man, is partly by the reliques of ſinne in vs, and partly by the obiects of this world heere
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18428:21"/> ſpoken of; therefore wee haue the more need to be called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by other, and alſo to prouoke our ſelues, <hi>to behold what loue the Father hath giuen vnto vs, to be called his children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We haue hawkes eies, and eagles eies to behold the glory of the world, and the worldly dignities of the ſonnes of men, and that euen in the twilight, yea in the darke night: we need not be carried vp to the top of an high mountaine, as our Sauiour was by the diuell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 8. Where note, that if the Diuell <note place="margin">Note.</note> had power ouer the outward man of Chriſt himſelfe, ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne to carrie him from place to place, we may not think much if he haue power to vex our bodies. Such things (I ſay) we can ſee eaſily enough in the loweſt valley: we need not be called vpon by other to behold them: wee doe too much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them of our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>But as touching this obiect of ſight heere ſpoken of, as <hi>Hagar ſaw not the Well of water that was hard by her, till God ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her eies, Geneſ</hi> 21. 19. and as the two Diſciples that were <hi>going from Ieruſalem to Emmaus,</hi> walked and talked with our Sauiour, <hi>Luc.</hi> 24. 16. and <hi>Mary</hi> did the like, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 24. and yet diſcerned him not, becauſe <hi>their eies were holden:</hi> ſo trulie is it, not only with naturall and vnregenerated men, but euen ſometimes with them that are the children of God. Though they be ſo, yet for many cauſes (heereafter to bee ſpoken of) they doe not alwaies diſcerne themſelues to bee ſo: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue need to bee ſpoken vnto, as heere the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Behold what great loue,</hi> &amp;c. Yea the more neceſſarie is it, that all men generally, and euen the children of God, be ſo ſpoken vnto in this behalfe, becauſe the word is the means whereby our eies ſhould bee opened at the firſt to behold this, and more and more afterward to behold it more cleerely. For <hi>the Commandement of the Lord is pure, and giueth light to the eies, Pſal.</hi> 19. 8. as in other things, ſo alſo in this. Therefore our Sauiour, in opening the eies of the bodily blinded men, did <note place="margin">Note.</note> not onely touch them and handle them, but alſo ſpake vnto them, thereby teaching, that as himſelfe <hi>is the Sonne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and the light of the world,</hi> ſo his word is the meanes whereby the eies of our minde are to be opened. Otherwiſe he could haue opened the bodily eies of men, without any
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18428:21"/> ſpeech at all vnto them. Therefore alſo the Apoſtle teſtifieth this to haue beene the end of his miniſterie with the Gentiles, euen to <hi>open their eies, that they might turne from darkneſſe to light, Act.</hi> 26. 18.</p>
                  <p>But this being a part of regeneration it ſelfe, it ſhall bee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſt afterward by proofe of the whole worke of our regeneration, to be by the word.</p>
                  <p>As it is neceſſary, that at all times wee ſhould be thus called vpon to conſider of Gods loue in making vs his children, ſo eſpecially the ſame is moſt neceſſarie in the time of trouble and aduerſitie. For when haue wee more need of the comfort thereof, then at ſuch times? For what greater comfort can there be, then in conſidering the loue of God in this behalfe? But becauſe this is one ſpeciall drift of this whole Treatiſe, therefore I ſhall not need in this place particularly to enlarge it. Thus much for obſeruation of the firſt particular word in this Scripture.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſecond word to be conſidered, is, <hi>What,</hi> or <hi>what manner.</hi> Hee doth not ſay, <hi>Behold the loue,</hi> but, <hi>Behold what loue,</hi> or, <hi>what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of loue,</hi> or, <hi>how great loue.</hi> This is a word commonly vſed in matters of admiration. When our Sauiour by his word had pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the windes and the ſeas, it is ſaid that the men that ſaw the ſaid miracle, <hi>maruelled, ſaying, What man is this,</hi> or <hi>what manner of man is this, that both the windes and the ſea obey him? Mat.</hi> 8. 27. In which place is the ſame word that is heere vſed by the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>So when the Angell was ſent to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to tell her that ſhe ſhould conceiue the Sonne of God in her wombe, and when he had ſaluted her in this ſort, <hi>Haile Mary,</hi> or, <hi>Reioice
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18428:22"/> Mary freely beloued,</hi> &amp;c. it is ſaid, that <hi>ſhe was troubled</hi> (or <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled) at this ſpeech, and thought what manner of ſalutation that ſhould be, Luc.</hi> 1. 29. where alſo is the ſame word that is in this place.</p>
               <p>This word therefore is an amplification of the loue of God in making vs his children, heere ſpoken of, by an adiunct or attribute that ſignifieth the ſame to be very great; yea, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great; yea, ſo great, that it is rather to be admired and wondered at, then any waies fully to be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>It ſignifieth as much as the word <hi>how</hi> in other places, as <hi>O Lord of Hoſts, how amiable are thy Tabernacles! Pſal.</hi> 84. 1. that is, ſo amiable, that they are alſo admirable. <hi>O how loue I thy Law! Pſal.</hi> 119. 97. that is, I loue thy Law with a loue that cannot bee expreſſed. I am euen ſicke of loue towards thy Law, as the Church ſpeaketh of her loue towards Chriſt, <hi>Cant. 2. 5. How beautifull are the feet of them that bring gladtidings of peace! Rom.</hi> 10. 15. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, ſo beautifull, that no tongue of man can expreſſe the beautie of them, no heart can well comprehend it. And indeed we ſhall ſee by the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling of this dignitie of the children of God, that it is ſuch, that as it is ſaid of making <hi>Christ the ſtone which was reiected of the builders, to bee the head ſtone of the corner, This was the Lords worke, and it is maruellous in our eies, Pſal.</hi> 118. 23. ſo it may be likewiſe ſaid of the worke of our adoption, and of the loue of God in making vs his children, <hi>This is the Lords worke, and it is maruellous in our eies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This circumſtance noted by this word, is to bee ioined with the former word, <hi>Behold,</hi> the more to prouoke vs to long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the knowledge of the excellencie of the children of God: eſpecially after that knowledge that is by experience, ſenſe, taſte, and feeling (as it were) of the excellencie thereof. For no man ſo well knoweth this excellencie, or can ſo well ſpeake or write thereof, as he that is partaker of it, and findeth the ſweetneſſe of it in himſelfe. For this is that <hi>white ſtone</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them that <hi>ouercome, wherein is a new name written, which no man knoweth, ſauing he that receiueth it, Reu.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>The rather is this to bee ioined with the former word, to make vs more deſirous of getting this title, and the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18428:22"/> to keepe it being gotten, yea to carry our ſelues according vnto it. All men doe gaze vpon the honourable titles of the world, and are in great admiration of them: but no man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt doth once looke after this: yea euery man (almoſt) in reſpect of the contempt wherein this name is with the world, (afterward to be ſpoken of in handling this obiection) is afraid to be called or knowen by this name. As <hi>many of the chiefe Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers that beleeued in Chriſt, for feare notwithſtanding of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes, durst not profeſſe him, Ioh.</hi> 12. 42. ſo many hearing ſo much as often times they do, of the dignity of Gods children, haue ſome deſire, and could be content to bee the children of God: but fearing the world, and the great men in the world, (eſpecially ſuch as to whom they doe ſpecially belong) are loth to be ſeene to haue any minde or affection that way. But of theſe more afterward. Thus much of the ſecond word in this text, preparing vs to thinke the more highly of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the children of God heere ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>The third word is <hi>Loue. Behold what loue:</hi> This word ſetteth foorth the fountaine or principall cauſe of making vs the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, to be <hi>the loue of God.</hi> So it is ſaid to bee the cauſe why God ſent or gaue his onely ſonne for vs, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. and. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 9. wherof we ſhall heare more afterward. If the loue of God be the fountaine of ſending his ſonne, then alſo it is of our making or adopting to bee the children of God. For whence is it that we are made the children of God? Is it not by Ieſus Chriſt? It cannot bee denied: and it ſhall afterward bee more plentifully prooued. Heerein the Lord differeth from men: for men cannot properly bee ſaid to beget children of <note place="margin">Note.</note> loue. There may be, and is in men, a deſire of children: but there cannot properly be a loue of children, till children bee begotten and borne. For how can men loue them that haue no being at all in nature? But God is ſaid to loue vs, and in loue of vs, to make vs his children, or to beget vs againe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſo his loue towards vs is before we are borne againe, or begotten againe vnto him. As this loue of God was before the action of our regeneration, ſo it continueth euer after. Gods loue is vnchangeable. As <hi>Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for euer, Heb.</hi> 13. 8. ſo is God in his loue towards them
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18428:23"/> whom he loueth: yea, there is not only no change in him, but alſo <hi>with him there is no variableneſſe nor ſhadow of turning: Iames</hi> 1. 17. But being to ſpeake of this loue againe afterward, this in this place ſhall be ſufficient thereof.</p>
               <p>The fourth word heere to be obſerued, is, <hi>the Father.</hi> As the former word ſetteth foorth the originall cauſe of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the children of God, ſo this ſetteth foorth the authour thereof, and the ſubject of that loue before ſpoken of: and that to be, not onely God, barely conſidered in his diuine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but as he is inueſted with the title of a Father.</p>
               <p>To ſpeake more plainly: The loue before ſpoken of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee are made the children of God, doth not come from God as he is God only, but as he is a Father: and that firſt of all, as he is the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore when the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of this matter, euen of our regeneration, he ſaith not only, <hi>Bleſſed be God,</hi> but hee ſaith further, <hi>euen the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant</hi> (or <hi>rich) mercy hath begotten vs againe, 1. Pet. 1. 3.</hi> God was alwaies the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt in the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of perſons in the diuine eſſence: and ſo Ieſus Chriſt, as the ſecond perſon in the Deitie, was alwaies the ſonne of the Father, euen before all times: ſo that there neuer was any time when the one of theſe two perſons was not the Father, and the other the Sonne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this loue heere ſpoken of, commeth from God, not only as he is the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, but alſo as by Ieſus Chriſt he is our Father. To ſpeake this alſo a little more plainly, the Apoſtle heere ſpeaking of himſelfe and of them to whom he did write, not only as the people of God, nor as the workes of God, but as the children of God, it was therefore the more ſit that hee ſhould deſcribe God by ſuch a title as was moſt anſwerable to that reſpect, wherein he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of himſelfe the writer, and of them to whom he did write. Theſe being, as they were, the children of God, it was more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the word children, that he ſhould ſay, <hi>Behold what loue the Father hath giuen vnto vs,</hi> then, <hi>Behold what loue God hath giuen vnto vs.</hi> For the word <hi>God</hi> doth more fitly anſwer to the word creatures, or people, and the word <hi>Father</hi> is a plain
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18428:23"/> correlatiue to the word children. Now although euer ſithence the creation, and ſithence the firſt time that there were any elect and beleeuing men, God was alwares their Father, yet as God was not ſo knowen to bee the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in the old Teſtament, and before the mearnation and manifeſtation of Chriſt in the fleth, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>thence: ſo God alſo <note place="margin">Note.</note> did not ſo plainly open and manifeſt himſelfe to be the father of the elect, as he hath done ſithence the time of the Goſpell. And therefore wee finde this title, <hi>Father,</hi> oſtener attributed vnto God in reſpect of Chriſt, and of the elect, in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, then in the old. In the old Teſtament he is moſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and made knowen by the name of <hi>The God of Abraham, the God of Izaak, and the God of Iaacob:</hi> but in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he maketh himſelfe knowen by the name of <hi>The Father of our Lord Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us Chriſt,</hi> and of them that by faith are made members of Chriſt, and <hi>fleſh of his fleſh,</hi> euen one bodie with him. As <hi>the grace of God, which bringeth ſaluation vnto all men,</hi> is ſaid eſpecially to haue (as it were) broken foorth thorow all the clouds of ceremonies and other things, whereby before it was obſcured, and ſo to haue ſhined more clecrelie and brightly now then euer before it did, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. ſo God doth make himſelfe knowen by this bleſſed, ſweet, and gratious name of <hi>Father,</hi> more now in the time of the Goſpell then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he did before.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon why the Apoſtle heere rather ſaith, <hi>Behold what loue the Father hath giuen vnto vs,</hi> &amp;c. then, <hi>Behold what Ioue God hath giuen vnto vs,</hi> And although the name <hi>God</hi> bee in the very next words vſed, <hi>(that wee ſhould bee called the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God)</hi> yet this is only to teach vs, that we are to conſider and apprehend God not onely in his diuine Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſtie, (which conſideration is enough to ſwallow vs vp, and to make vs feare and tremble) but alſo in the perſon of a Father, and as hee is our Father.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, this that I haue hitherto ſaid of this word <hi>the Father,</hi> is not ſo to be reſtrained to the firſt perſon in the Godhead, but that therein alſo is included the Sonne. As in the former Chapter, verſ. 22. 23. and 24. the Apoſtle had ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them together, making <hi>the deniall of the Sonne to be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18428:24"/> of the Father,</hi> and <hi>the continu ince in the Sonne and in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to be all one. And as our Sauiour himſelfe doth the like, ſaying, that <hi>He that honoureth not the Sonne, the ſame honoureth not the Father that hath ſent him, Ich.</hi> 5. 23. ſo in this place, the word <hi>Father</hi> is not perſonally to be vnderſtood, but rather eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially, as comprehending the Sonne as well as the Father. Therefore, as there it is ſaid, <hi>Behold what loue the Father hath giuen vnto vs, that we ſhould be called the Children of God:</hi> ſo it is alſo ſaid by the ſame ſpirit, that directed the pen of this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, euen of the Sonne, that <hi>he came to his owne, and his owne receiued him n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t: but as many as receiued him, to them hee gane power to be made the children of God, Iohn</hi> 1. 12. Therefore the ſpirit of God, which is the immortall ſeed whereby we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten againe vnto God, and made the children of God, (as afterward we ſhall heare) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. &amp;c. and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten elſwhere, is called the ſpirit of Chriſt, as well as the ſpirit of the Father, and therefore alſo Chriſt in that reſpect may be as well ſaid to beget vs againe vnto God, to make vs the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and <hi>to giue vs this loue, that wee ſhould be called the children of God,</hi> as the Father and the firſt perſon in the Deitie. To conclude this point, as when we pray and ſay, <hi>Our Father which art in heauen,</hi> we direct our praiers immediately to the perſon of the Father by a kinde of excellencie, becauſe he is <hi>Principium Deitatis,</hi> (not in time, but in order) <hi>the beginning of the Deitie:</hi> and yet in the Father we pray alſo to the Sonne and to the holy Ghoſt: ſo in this place this word <hi>the Father</hi> is to be vnderſtood as well of the Sonne as of the Father. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore in the very next verſe, without any further expreſſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sonne, vſing only a relatiue, and thereby making a relation to that before ſpoken in this verſe, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that we know, that when hee ſhall appeare</hi> (or be made manifeſt) <hi>we ſhall be made like v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Furthermore, the addition of this word ſerueth to teach,

               <p>Touching both our iuſtification and calling (whereby wee are made the children of God) the ſame Apoſtle alſo ſaith, that <hi>God hath ſaued vs, and called vs with an holy calling, not according to our workes, but according to his owne purpoſe and grace: 2. Tim.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>In all theſe places, and touching theſe points, who ſeeth not a moſt euident oppoſition of Gods grace to our worthl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that Gods grace doth exclude our worthineſle? I grant ſometime grace mentioned, and ſometime mercie, and that there is ſome diſtinction betwixt grace and mercie (as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſhall be ſhewed) yet there is alſo ſuch affinity betwixt them, that as two brethren being very like one another, are ſometimes taken one for another; ſo alſo theſe two words (in this argument eſpecially) are confounded, and the one vſed for another.</p>
               <p>Now let it bee noted that I ſaid grace was oppoſed to our <note place="margin">Note.</note> worthlneſſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When we heare that God hath freely of his owne loue made vs his children, this indeed excludeth al worthineſſe of vs and in vs, from being any cauſe of making vs the children of God. Notwithſtanding if wee looke to Chriſt Ieſus and to that that he hath done, it is certain that God hath not, either ſaued vs freely, or freely ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Otherwiſe if we looke to that which Chriſt did for vs, being ſo freely giuen or ſent in the world, in our behalfe, it is certaine that Chriſt Ieſus by his paſſiue and actiue righteouſnes, that is, by thoſe things which hee ſuffred, and by that obedience which otherwiſe he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto God his Father for vs, hath both iuſtified vs, and alſo purchaſed this honour for vs, of being the children of God. Though therefore wee haue this honour freely and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Gods free grace in reſpect of our ſelues; yet it is not ſo free in reſpect of Chriſt (his ſending only of Gods free grace excepted) becauſe (as we ſhall afterward heare more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18428:26"/> Chriſt hath moſt deerely bought all that wee haue, and moſt ſweetly paid for it, in the ſatisfying the iuſtice of God in our behalfe. Thus much for the firſt conſideration, why the Apoſtle vſeth this phraſe, that God <hi>hath giuen vs this lone of calling vs his children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond conſideration is for the diſtinguiſhing of vs from Chriſt Ieſus, and to teach, that though wee bee the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or ſonnes of God, yet there is great difference betwixt Chriſt and vs in this behalfe. Chriſt, as hee is the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Deity, is the Sonne of God immediately by nature, by communication of the whole eſſence of the Father vnto him, and from all eternitie before all times: ſo that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was any time when God was not his Father, &amp;c. as hath beene before ſaid.</p>
               <p>As Chriſt alſo was man, he was the Sonne of God, by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous conception of the holy Ghoſt, and by a moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full coniunction of the godhead and manhood together hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatically in one perſon. But we are the ſonnes, or children of God immediately, and only by grace, by gift, by ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ption, in, by, and through Chriſt Ieſus, being incorporated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into him, that is in himſelfe the naturall, the eternall, &amp; the only ſonne of God; hauing no fellowes, either amongſt men, or amongſt Angels. Therefore hee is called Gods <hi>owne Sonne, Rom.</hi> 8. 32. his <hi>firſt be gotten Sonne, Heb.</hi> 1. 6. and <hi>his only be gotten Sonne, Iohn</hi> 1. 14. and 3. 16. and 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 9.</p>
               <p>Now, as heere it is ſaid, that <hi>God hath giuen vs this loue, to be called his children;</hi> ſo it is alſo ſaid, that <hi>to as many as receiued him</hi> (that is, Chriſt) <hi>hee gaue prerogatiue to be the ſonnes of God, euen to them that beleeue in his name. Ioh.</hi> 1. 12. In which place the holy Ghoſt ſheweth the meanes more plainly, whereby we are the ſonnes or children of God: namely, by receiuing Chriſt by faith, and by being through faith ingrafted into Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Howſoeuer therefore wee bee called the ſonnes of God as well as Chriſt, yet there is great difference betwixt Chriſt and vs in this behalfe: and Chriſt is in a farre more excellent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Sonne of God, then either we or the Angels can claime the ſame title and prerogatiue.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:18428:26"/>
               <p>Let vs heere note one thing more: viz. that the Apoſtle <note place="margin">Note.</note> ſpeaketh not in the preſent time, ſaying, <hi>doth giue;</hi> but in the time paſt, ſaying, <hi>hath giuen.</hi> This obſeruation is not to bee vnderſtood onely of the firſt actuall beginning of our adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and regeneration, but alſo of Gods eternall election of vs thereunto before the making of the world. For ſo the ſame phraſe in the ſame tenſe importeth elſewhere. <hi>The Father that hath giuen them vnto me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iohn 10. 29. As thou haſt giuen him power ouer all fleſh, that he ſhould giue eternall life to all them that thou baſt giuen him, Iohn 17. 2.</hi> And againe: <hi>I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thy name to the men which thou gaueſt me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gaueſt them mee.</hi> verſe 6. In this one verſe is the ſame word and tenſe twice. The ſame phraſe and tenſe is often vſed afterward in the ſame chapter, to the ſame purpoſe, viz. verſe 7. verſe 9. and verſe 12. So before he had ſaid, <hi>This is the Fathers will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me, I ſhould loſe nothing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 39.

               <p>Yea, ſo much the more may we cry out with ſuch admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as before) of this loue of God, becauſe herein God hath paſſed ouer the Angels that fel as we had fallen, and hath not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed them the like loue, for reſtoring them, and making them his children, that he hath vouchſafed vnto vs. But of this more afterward. In the meane time this briefly ſhall ſuffice for this ſixt word.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth is, <hi>that we ſhould be called.</hi> What meaneth the Apoſtle by this phraſe? That we ſhould only haue the name <note place="margin">That we ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> and title of Gods children, and not be indeede the children of God? Not ſo, for our Sauiour reproueth the Angell of the Church of <hi>Sardi For hauing a name to be aliue, who yet was dead, Reuel.</hi> 3. 1. In the world indeed ſo it is oftentimes, that men haue bare names and titles, &amp; not the thing or benefit ſignified by ſuch names, or belonging to ſuch names and titles. <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> was ſaluted by this name of King, <hi>God ſaue the King, God ſaue the King. 2 Sam.</hi> 16. 16. And that not onely by <hi>Huſhai the Archit</hi> in policy, but alſo by many other; yet hee was not the King. The like title was for a time giuen alſo to <hi>Adonija 1. King.</hi> 1. 18. Yet he was not the King. So we haue known the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18428:27"/> name of the king of <hi>Portugal,</hi> giuen to one, that had no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uileges or royalties belonging to that name. So ſome noble men being condemned for high treaſon, and thereby tainted in their bloud, and hauing loſt all then honours, are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by many whiles they liue, in courteſy called by ſuch honorable names as before they had: though they haue no other priuiledges belonging to ſuch honorable names: the cutting off only of their heads excepted, whereas meaner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the like treſpaſſes are hanged, drawen, and quartered. Thus (I ſay) it is in the world, and with men of the world. But this is not the meaning of the Apoſtle in this place, but that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we be, as well as called, the children of God.

This is manifeſt by the very next verſe, where the Apoſtle ſaith not <hi>Dearely beloued, now are we called the ſonnes of God, but now we be the ſonnes of God.</hi> So alſo the word <hi>called</hi> is taken in ſome other places.</p>
               <p>The Angell ſayth of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the virgine <hi>Mary Thou ſhalt call his name Ieſus Luc.</hi> 1. 31. And againe: <hi>he ſhall be called the Son of the moſt high, verſe</hi> 32. Doth the Angel meane Chriſt ſhould be called <hi>Ieſus,</hi> or <hi>Sauiour,</hi> and not bee a Ieſus or Sauiour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? or that he ſhould only be called the <hi>ſonne of the moſt high,</hi> and not be ſo indeed? verily he had no ſuch meaning.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt ſayth of the temple, <hi>Mine houſe ſhall be called the houſe of praier &amp;c. Marke</hi> 11. 17. his meaning is that it ſhould be ſo indeed. So therfore is the meaning of the ſame phraſe in this place.</p>
               <p>But why doth the Apoſtle rather vſe this phraſe, then plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Note.</note> ſay, that wee ſhould bee his children? It may bee hee would heerby inſinuate, the meanes whereby we come to this honor, to be the outward calling by the miniſtry of the word. As when our Sauiour ſayth, <hi>I came not to call the rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>teous; but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to repentance: Mat.</hi> 9. 13. hee inſinuateth his calling by the word to bee the meanes of repentance; ſo the Apoſtle by this phraſe, <hi>that we ſhould be called the children of God,</hi> may inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate the outward calling by the preaching of the word, to bee the meanes whereby God bringeth vs to this honour of his children.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:18428:28"/>
               <p>Secondly, (not to ſtand vpon this reaſon) by this phraſe that <hi>we ſhould be called,</hi> he meaneth, not only that we ſhould bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his children: but alſo that we ſhould be ſo known and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, yea, publikely proclaimed to all the world to bee the children of God. As an other Apoſtile ſayth, <hi>that God was not aſhamed to bee called the God of his ancient people Hebr.</hi> 11. 16. (Where alſo note the phraſe, <hi>to be called,</hi> to ſignify ſo to bee indeed) ſo heere this Apoſtle telleth vs, that God is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that wee ſhould profeſſe our ſelues to bee, and that wee ſhould be called by other, his children. Herein therefore God differeth from many men, eſpecially from ſome princes, who though they purpoſe ſecretly with themſelues, whom by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption to make their children (hauing none by nature) and to whom to leaue their inheritances or their Crownes, yet for ſome conſiderations they will not haue this to be known. But it is otherwiſe with God. He hath ſo loued vs, that he doth not only make vs his children, but that alſo hee doth declare and publiſh and proclaime vs ſo to be.</p>
               <p>3 From the former reaſon ariſeth another, viz. that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle vſeth this phraſe to teach vs, that if he be not aſhamed, that ſuch as we are, ſhould bee called his children, then much leſſe ſhould we our ſelues be aſhamed of this honourable title. If a great king be not aſhamed that the ſonne of a poore beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſhould bee called his ſonne, is there any cauſe, why the ſaid ſonne of ſuch a poore begger, ſhould be aſhamed to bee called the ſonne of ſuch a great King. In like manner, if God the king of kings, be nor aſhamed that we poore beggers brats ſhould be called his children, is there any reaſon, why wee ſhould bee aſhamed of ſo honourable a title? I could much amplify this point. But for further amplification therof, I do only wiſh, that if any for feare of the diſgrace of the world (to be ſpoken of in the obiection following) be aſhamed to call himſelfe the child of God, and to carry himſelfe accordingly: ſuch an one do wel remember, what our Sauiour ſaith of <hi>them that are aſhamed of him. &amp; of his words, before ſuch an adulterous &amp; ſinfull generation (viz.</hi> as this laſt age of the world is where in we now liue) to wit that he alſo <hi>will be aſhamed of him, when he ſhall come in the glory of his Father, with the holy Angels Mark.</hi> 8. 38. For certainely in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18428:28"/> like manner will God the Father bee aſhamed of all ſuch, and wil vtterly deny them to be his children in the world to come, that were aſhamed to bee called his children, and to liue as his children in this life. Yea this is the more certaine, becauſe there is infinitely more cauſe why God ſhould bee aſhamed of vs, then why wee ſhould be aſhamed of him. Thus much of the ſeuenth particular word in this text.</p>
               <p>The eighth word is, <hi>the children of God.</hi> Some read, <hi>the ſonnes of God:</hi> but the originall is, <hi>the children of God:</hi> comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſonnes and daughters, men and women: and ſo the ſame word is vſed, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. and 11. 52. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. 17. and in many other places.</p>
               <p>This is to be obſerued, for the comfort as well of women, as of men; and for the inſtruction (as afterward wee ſhall heare) of one ſex as well as of the other. And therefore the Apoſtle allegeth the words of the Prophet in the name of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſpeaking in this manner: <hi>I will be a Father vnto you, and ye ſhall be my ſonnes and daughters, ſaith the Lord Almightie. 2. Cor.</hi> 6. 18. Heere wee ſee expreſſe mention as well of daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as of ſonnes. This is to be the rather noted, becauſe ſome in the brauery of their wit (or rather in the rage of their mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) doe not ſticke to deny women to haue any part in the matters of ſaluation: although the Scripture doe both expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſay, that <hi>there is no exception of male or female with God, but that all are one in Chriſt Ieſus, Galat.</hi> 3. 28. and although it doe alſo record vnto vs example as well of beleeuing women as of beleeuing men.</p>
               <p>But what doth the Apoſtle heere meane by children? For the vnderſtanding of this, beſides diuers other waies how men may be, and are called the children of God, let vs know that in a more ſtrict ſenſe, this title, <hi>the children of God,</hi> is taken two waies: Firſt, for all the members of the viſible Church, ſo long as they continue ſuch members, and that becauſe of the outward couenant of God made with the whole body of the viſible Church. In this ſenſe it is ſaid, <hi>The ſonnes of God ſaw the daughters of men, that they were faire, &amp;c. Geneſ.</hi> 6. 2. Heere the ſonnes of God doe ſignifie ſuch as profeſſed themſelues the ſonnes of God, and ſo were of the viſible Church. In the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18428:29"/> ſame ſenſe alſo our Sauiour himſelfe calleth the Iewes (euen in his time) generally by the name of children, ſaying, <hi>It is not meet to take the childrens bread, and to caſt it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>helpes: Matt.</hi> 15. 26. Secondly, this title, <hi>the children of God,</hi> is taken for them that haue receiued the ſpirit of adoption, and that are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the immortall ſeed of the ſpirit, and by the word of God. So it is taken in the place before alleged, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. 17. and often elſewhere: and ſo only (not in the former ſenſe) is it taken in this place. For the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of them <hi>that worke righteouſly, and are borne of God,</hi> as wee haue heard in the end of the former chapter: and of them that <hi>know that when Chriſt ſhall appeare they ſhall be like him,</hi> as appeareth in the next verſe. But none <hi>worke righteouſly,</hi> &amp;c. neither doe any <hi>know they ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l be like vnto Chriſt at his appearing,</hi> but onely they that are by the ſpirit of God regenerated: and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly of ſuch in this place.</p>
               <p>To ſpeake a little more of adoption and regeneration; for <note place="margin">Note.</note> the making thereof the plainer and more perſpicuous, wee muſt vnderſtand that the adoption of God differeth much from the adoption of men. For the ciuill Lawyers that write of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h thus betwixt adoption and arrogation; that arrogation is the taking of one to bee a childe, which is already of age, and at libertie, and (as we ſay) at his owne hand, and his owne man: but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option is of one vnder age, and of one that is in tuition, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and gardianſhip of another: the ciuill Lawyers (I ſay) doe not onely write thus of adoption, but they alſo ſay, that adoption properly is when one that hath no children of his owne, doth adopt the childe of ſome other to be called by his name, or at leaſt to be brought vp by him, and to bee his heire. God doth not ſo adopt vs: for hee hath a Sonne of his owne: yea more properly his owne, then any man can ſay of any childe in the world, becauſe Chriſt is the proper Sonne of God from euerlaſting, by communication (as wee haue heard) of the whole eſſence of his Father vnto him.</p>
               <p>But the children of men are their children long after them,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18428:29"/> and therefore they are yoonger then their fathers. They are alſo children by taking ſome part of their parents nature, and that of their bodily ſubſtance only: for their ſoules are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from God: who therefore by oppoſition to the fathers of our bodies, is called <hi>the Father of ſpirits, Heb.</hi> 12. 9. and is ſaid <hi>to forme the ſpirit of man, Zechar.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
               <p>As for the great obiection that doth moſt trouble men, viz. if <note place="margin">Note.</note> God immediately make our ſoules, how then c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me we ſtained with originall ſinne? it may receiue a double anſwer: Firſt, that they come by ſinne at their entrance into the body: as in old time men might get the leproſie by entring into an houſe only infected with the leproſie: and as men may now get the plague by going to the houſe lately viſited therewith, though no man dwell in the ſaid houſe: as alſo by putting on a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comming from one that had the plague. For the body is an houſe, or garment of the ſoule, comming from our pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted and defiled parents. Secondly, touching the ſaid great obiection, it is altogether curious to inquire of the manner, when the thing is manifeſt. For a man may as well inquire of <note place="margin">Note.</note> them that were raiſed from death to life by the Prophets, and by our Sauiour, and his Apoſtles, eſpecially of the faithfull ſo raiſed <hi>(Lazarus, Dorcas,</hi> &amp;c.) how after their ſaid reſtoring to life againe, they became ſinners againe, and ſo ſubiect to death againe. For being dead, and their ſoules and bodies in death ſeparated, it cannot be denied, but that during that time, they were free from ſinne, both in body and in ſoule. If therefore this bee a curious queſtion, how they became againe def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>led with ſinne, and to need to pray for <hi>forgiueneſſe of their treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> then alſo is the former. For there is the like reaſon of the one and of the other. To returne to our former ſpeech of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option, although God haue ſuch a Sonne of his owne, in whom he is well pleaſed, yea many other ſonnes likewiſe by creation, keeping ſtill that glorious image wherein they were created; (viz. al the bleſſed Angels) yet becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> had tranſgreſſed, and that through his fal he had no children amongſt the ſons of men, therefore it pleaſed him alſo to adopt vs vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. This then is one difference betwixt the adoption of God and the adoption of men: that men only adopt children when
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18428:30"/> they haue none of their owne: but God adopteth vs though he haue one of his owne by nature, and many by creation like vnto himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Another difference is, that when men doe adopt, there is <note place="margin">Note.</note> not, neither can be any ſecond generation of him that is adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whereby to make him like to him that doth adopt him, being before vnlike vnto him. For to make one like to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, paſſeth the worke of any man. But in our adoption to God there is not onely an acceptation of vs for his children, but there is alſo an actuall regeneration and ſecond birth wrought in vs by Gods ſpirit (therefore called the ſpirit of adoption) whereby we are made like to our Father that doth adopt vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, men hauing no children of their owne, cannot adopt other in any or by any: but God hauing a Sonne of his owne (as we ſaid) doth in him, and by him, and through him, (as it were by marying of vs vnto him, and incorporating vs into him) adopt vs for his children.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, touching adoption, the whole number of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren adopted to God, conſidered iointly together, are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as one, viz. as a <hi>daughter,</hi> ſo made by marriage to the only Sonne of God, <hi>Pſal. 45. 10. Hoſ.</hi> 2. 9. in which reſpect the whole Catholike Church, comprehending all the elect and children of God (and no other) is often called by the name of a Spouſe, and of one ſpouſe vnto Chriſt, <hi>Cantic</hi> 4. 8. 9. 10. and 5. 1. <hi>Iohn 3. 29. Reu</hi> 21. 2. and 9. and as of one wife, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 3. 1. &amp;c. and the Church is ſaid to be <hi>but one, euen one alone, and the only daughter of her mother, Cantic. 6. 8. and one body in Chriſt, Rom. 12. 5. 1. Cor. 12. 12. Epheſ.</hi> 4. 4. But the children of God being ſeuerally conſidered, according to the ſeuerall ſex of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one, they are called the ſonnes and daughters of God, as before we heard.

               <p>Let him alſo conſider his moſt wiſe, powerfull, righteous, gratious, and euery way moſt admirable adminiſtration, and gouernment of all things in heauen, in earth, in the waters, and vnder earth and water. For as God made all things at the firſt moſt excellently, ſo he ſtill gouerneth all things according to his firſt creation of them.</p>
               <p>If God himſelfe be thus excellent, how can his children be but excellent? For all the children of God are in ſome meaſure made like vnto him, euen in power, wiſedome, holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, as afterward we ſhall heare. And they are not his children (by adoption and regeneration) that do not in the former things ſomewhat reſemble him. Many men indeed haue children nothing like them, either in fauour or in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. But certainly there are none of the children of God,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18428:32"/> but are in part like vnto himſelfe, yea, this is a moſt certaine note of a child of God, to haue the <hi>Character</hi> and ſimilitude and image of God vpon him and in him.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Adam</hi> who was the ſonne of God by creation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 38. was at the firſt (male and female) made and formed in the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and ſimilitude of God, ſo likewiſe are all theſe children of God by regeneration, of whom now I ſpeake. How great therefore is this their dignity? The dignity of the ſonnes of men is meaſured according to the dignity of their fathers: as alſo according to their reſemblance of them. Therefore the dignity of Kings being the greateſt dignity of the ſonnes of men, their children are accounted moſt honorable and moſt noble; yea to be but ſonne in law to a king, by mariage onely of a kings daughter, is accounted, &amp; is indeed a very great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement: eſpecially for a poore and meane man. When <hi>Saul</hi> the firſt king of Iſrael, and a wicked King, giuen in the Lords anger, offered his daughter <hi>Merab</hi> vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> what anſwered <hi>Dauid? Who am I, or what is my life or the family of my father in Iſrael, that I ſhould be ſonne in law to the King?</hi> When againe <hi>Sauls</hi> ſeruants (ſet a worke by <hi>Saul</hi> himſelfe) ſpake with <hi>Dauid</hi> ſecretly, to perſwade him to take <hi>Michael,</hi> (an other of <hi>Sauls</hi> daughters, <hi>Merab</hi> being giuen to <hi>Adriel)</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Behold the King hath a fauour vnto thee, and all his ſeruants loue thee: Be now therefore the Kings ſonne in lawe.</hi> He anſwered againe to the ſame effect, that before he had done, <hi>Seemeth it to you alight thing, to be a Kings ſonne in lawe, ſeeing I am a poore man and of ſmall reputation? 1. Sam.</hi> 18 18. 22. 23. So <hi>Dauid,</hi> that could tell how to iudge of things, (as being then a Prophet, and hauing before that, written the 9. Pſalme vpon the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Goliah)</hi> accounted it a very great dignity, (yea, too great for him being a meane perſon) to be but ſonne in law to a King, to the firſt king of Iſrael, (and therefore the leaſt; for as naturall things are leaſt at their firſt birth or ſpringing vp; ſo the dignities of men, of Kings, and other, are leaſt at the firſt, and in time doe increaſe and grow to a greater ſtate, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) yea, alſo to a wicked King. For <hi>Saul</hi> before that, had ſhewed his wickedneſſe, both in offering ſacrifice before <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi> comming &amp; contrary to his direction. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18428:32"/> in ſparing of <hi>Agag,</hi> and the beſt of the Amalekites ſheepe and Oxen. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. Who then can ſufficiently expreſſe the dignity of them that are the children of <hi>the moſt high God, King of kings, &amp;c.</hi> by mariage vnto Chriſt Ieſus, by adoption, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation into him?</p>
               <p>Furthermore, concerning theſe children of God, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that before ſaid touching their regeneration by God himſelfe. It is the worke of God only to make a child of God in this maner. In the time of the law (to ſpeake according to the phraſe of thoſe times) men might beget children to other, and raiſe vp ſeed vnto other.</p>
               <p>For we know that a man after mariage dying without iſſue, <note place="margin">Note.</note> the next of that kindred (not maried before) was bound to take the wife of him deceaſed; and ſo to raiſe ſeed vnto him: and this ſeed ſo raiſed, was accounted the ſeed of the dead, not of the liuing. <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 5. 6. By adultery alſo in theſe daies the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſome are accounted the children of other. But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to raiſe vp ſuch children to God, as here I intreate of, is the worke only of God himſelfe. Men and Angels cannot beget ſuch a ſonne or daughter vnto God. This hath been proued by teſtimonies of Scripture before. Notwithſtanding, I will now further prooue the ſame by the greatneſſe of the ſayd worke of regeneration. For indeed it is the greateſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: (the perſonall vnion of the diuine and humane nature in the perſon of Chriſt only excepted) becauſe it containeth (almoſt) all miracles mentioned in the Goſpell to haue been wrought vpon men. What be thoſe miracles? The giuing ſight to the blind: hearing to the deafe: ſpeech to the dumb: health to the ſicke: ſtrength to the lame: cleanneſſe to the leapers: life to the dead: and releaſe and liberty to them that were poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of diuels. All theſe are wrought at once in the worke of our regeneration. Wheras we were by nature ſpiritually blind, the eyes of our mind are lightned to ſee the great things of God, and the deepe ſecrets of his kingdome. Whereas by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are ſpiritually deafe, our hearts are opened, that our eares do attend to the word of God. Whereas by nature we are ſpiritually dumb, not able to ſpeake a good word, our lips are ſo opened, that our mouth doth ſhew foorth the praiſe of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18428:33"/> God, and is able to ſpeak of righteouſneſſe. Whereas by nature we were ſpiritually ſicke, heart ſicke, ſicke vnto death: we are in regeneration reſtored to ſpirituall health in part, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> aſſured of perfect recouery of all our ſpirituall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at the laſt. Whereas by nature we were ſpiritually lame and impotent, not able to ſtirre hand or foot toward any thing that good is, we are in regeneration made ſtrong (in time) to walke about, and to doe the workes of God in ſome meaſure. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Whereas by nature, we were wholly defiled from the crowne of the head to the ſole of the foot, with a moſt noyſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall leproſie, ten thouſand times more infectious and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, then any bodily leproſie: we are in regeneration clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereof, and made as whole (as we ſay) as a roch: yea, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by nature we were dead in our ſinnes, we are in regeneration, raiſed vp to the life of God. Finally whereas by nature, wee were poſſeſſed ſpiritually of the diuell: yea, touching both our ſoules and bodies in his thraldome, not able to doe any thing, but what he would haue vs to doe and doing that with all delight: we are in regeneration releaſed of this bondage and made the freemen of God himſelfe; Are not all theſe great things? How did men admire the leaſt ſuch miracle, wrought vpon the bodies of men. <hi>Since the world began</hi> (ſaith the blind man reſtored to bodily ſight) <hi>it was not heard, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man opened the eyes of one that was borne blind. Ioh.</hi> 9. 32. How great then and how wonderfull is the worke of all the former miracles, at one inſtant wrought. Verily farre greater, vpon the inner man, and being ſpiritually wrought then all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer outwardly wrought vpon the outward man: yea, all the former are the greater, becauſe by working of them in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, we are in a moment aduanced from hell to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The diſciples which <hi>Iohn</hi> ſent vnto Chriſt to know whether he were the Meſſias or no, or whether they ſhould looke for another, were returned by Chriſt to <hi>Iohn</hi> with this meſſage, <hi>Goe and ſhew Iohn what things ye heare and ſee: The blind receiue ſight, the halt doe goe: and the leapers are cleanſed, and the deafe heare; the dead are raiſed vp:</hi> and laſtly he addeth as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all, <hi>the poore receiue the Goſpell. Mat.</hi> 11. 4. 5.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:18428:33"/>
               <p>How did the poore receiue the Goſpell? viz. to their rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of being the children of God. And that the meaning of our Sauiour by ſetting this in the laſt place, was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it as the greateſt, it appeareth, becauſe in the place next before that, he had mentioned the greateſt of all the former. For who will deny <hi>the raiſing vp of the dead</hi> to be greater then making <hi>the blind to ſee, the halt to goe, the leapers to be cleane, or the deafe to heare?</hi> The proofe of all theſe particular miracles to be wrought in our regeneration, wee ſhall heare after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, hereby it is moſt euident, that the worke of our regeneration is the worke only of God. For God only worketh all miracles. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God, euen the God of Iſrael, which only doth wondrous things. Pſal. 72. 18. Thou artgreat, and doſt wondrous things; thou art God alone. Pſa.</hi> 86. 10. So the Prophet proueth God to be <hi>God alone,</hi> by the effect <hi>of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wondrous things. Praiſe ye the Lord of Lords: for his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for euer, which only doth great wonders. Pſal. 136. 3. 4. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> an Heathen could acknowledge the <hi>working of ſignes and wonders in heauen and in earth as a thing belonging to God only. Dan.</hi> 6. 27. And indeed, if the working of miracles did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God only, it had beene no good argument of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour to returne the meſſengers of <hi>Iohn</hi> with report of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, for demonſtration of himſelfe to be the Meſſias which ſhould come, and no other to be looked for. If any that is lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned deſire further handling of this generall point, I referre him to <hi>Beza</hi> againſt <hi>Holderus,</hi> in pages 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To returne to the former matter, the worke of our rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is not only a miracle, and the greateſt miracle of all other (except only before excepted) but it is alſo as great as the creation of man at the firſt. For therefore it is called by the very name of a creation. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, let him bee a new creature. 2. Cor. 5. 17. In Chriſt Ieſus neither circumciſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth any thing nor vncircumciſion, but a new creature. Galat. 6. 15. We are his workmanſhip created in Christ Ieſus. Epheſ. 2. 10. Our new man</hi> alſo is ſaid to be <hi>created in Chriſt Ieſus. Epheſ.</hi> 4. 24. Neither is our regeneration, as great only as the firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18428:34"/> of man, but alſo greater; yea, then the firſt creation of all things. This is manifeſt by theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the firſt creation, was (as it were) but one worke: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> namely to make that which was not made before. But in this worke of regeneration, there is a double worke, firſt to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our naturall corruption, ſecondly in ſtead thereof to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and forme Gods owne image.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the firſt creation, there was no oppoſition, no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> no let, no hinderance to God. But in our regeneration, there are many and mighty enemies, and many great lets and hinderances, and as it were blocks layd in Gods way. Satan himſelfe with all his angels and the whole power of hell, do labor what they can to hinder t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s worke: So alſo doth the whole world with all the power thereof: Our hearts likewiſe with all the thoughts, luſts, and affections thereof, and our whole man doe ſtriue and ſtruggle with God, by all meanes reſiſting him, and oppoſing themſelues vnto this worke.</p>
               <p>Yea, ſometimes the children of God themſelues (euen being regenerated) doe interpoſe and oppoſe themſelues to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of other. For did not <hi>Iohn</hi> ſay to our Sauiour: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, wee ſaw one caſting out diuels by thy name, which followeth not vs: and we forbad him, becauſe he followed vs not? Mark.</hi> 9. 38. Could <hi>Iohn</hi> and the other diſciples with him, forbid another caſting out of diuels, in the name of Chriſt, and not hinder the worke of regeneration?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> aduiſed Chriſt not to goe to Ieruſalem there to ſuffer thoſe things which he was to ſuffer: <hi>Marke</hi> 8. 32. The like did all the Apoſtles: <hi>Ioh. 11. 8. Peter</hi> alſo ſeeing Chriſts glory in the mountaine, where Chriſt transfigured himſelfe, being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed therewith, would haue had Chriſt to haue continued there ſtill, and to haue built three Tabernacles, one for him, another for <hi>Moſes,</hi> a third for <hi>Elias. Mark.</hi> 9. 5. Could Chriſt by the foreſaid counſell haue auoided death, and not haue hindered the whole worke of mans redemption, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo of his adoption and regeneration? yea, had not the hinderance of Chriſts death, been the way to haue fet all the ſaints from heauen, that in their ſoules had been there before, by vertue of Chriſts death, after their tranſlation into heauen,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18428:34"/> to be ſuffered for them in earth? The taking away of the cauſe muſt needs be the nullifying of the effects, depending vpon that cauſe. If any in great place, doe beſtow an office vpon an other as pretending the beſtowing thereof to belong vnto his place; ſhall not the receiuer of that office (though hauing for ſometime enioied the ſame) be diſpoſſeſſed thereof after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by another, that ſhall find the right of collating the ſame to be in him, and neuer to haue been in the other that before had beſtowed it? The like might beſayd euen of the diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing of the ſoules of the righteous of heauen it ſelfe, if they had been admitted thereunto by virtue of his death, that had not died.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, touching the difficulty of our ſecond creation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the firſt: in our ſayd firſt creation God did no more for vs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in our kind, then for all other creatures in their kind. He made vs perfect: and ſo he made euery other creature perfect in his kind. But in our ſecond creation, God doth not only more for vs, then for the Angels that had fallen, but alſo then for the Angels that ſtand, as afterward we ſhall heare.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in the firſt creation, God wrought as God alone: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> but in our ſecond creation, regeneration and adoption, it was needfull that God ſhould be made man, and that God and man made one perſon, ſhould worke the ſaid worke of our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond creation, regeneration and adoption, as afterward alſo we ſhall heare more largely.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, our firſt creation, and the firſt creation of all things, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> was made as of nothing, ſo alſo for nothing. But our ſecond creation was not only wrought of nothing, and of leſſe (or at leaſt worſe) then nothing, (for the new man is formed in vs, but not of vs) but it was alſo wrought at a price, or by a price. <note place="margin">Note.</note> For Chriſt gaue himſelfe for vs, and we are ſaid, to be bought with a price: as likewiſe ſhall be ſhewed anon.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, the firſt creation of all things was perfected, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> conſummated in ſix daies: but albeit our regeneration be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in a moment; yet it groweth by ſmall degrees: yea, if one of the children of God be inclined to ſome ſpeciall ſinne (as who is not?) how hard a thing is it in long time, and by many m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>es to repreſſe and reforme the ſame? And though a man
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18428:35"/> doe liue many yeeres after his regeneration begun, yet it is neuer perfected in this life; neither ſhall be, till our corruptible bodies haue put on incorruption; and till that that is mortall be made immortall.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, to illuſtrate this by ſimilitude, as it is more eaſie for the potter, or glaſſe man, to make an whole houſe full of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> pots or glaſſes, then to ſet one together, and make it as ſound as it was, being broken all to peeces: ſo was it more eaſie for God at the firſt, to make an whole world of creatures, then now only to reſtore, and build man vp againe, and (as it were to ſet him together againe) being (touching the image of God in him) deſtroied, and (as it were) broken in peeces.</p>
               <p>All this of the difficulty of our ſecond creation, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon <note place="margin">Note.</note> of the firſt creation, is to be vnderſtood, but only in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of mans iudgement touching the difficulty of things: not ſimply in conſideration of Gods power. For to ſpeake ſimply of Gods power, all things are alike thereunto. There is nothing harder or eaſier then another with God. It is as eaſie for him to make an whole world, yea, many worlds, as to make the leaſt creature.</p>
               <p>By this greatneſſe of this worke, the worke it ſelfe is the more manifeſt, to be the worke only of God. For if to make a man, or to make an whole world, be not the worke of any but of God himſelfe (as the whole Scripture teacheth vs) how much leſſe may we ſay, that any but God alone can regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a man and make a man the child of God? this worke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as hath beene ſhewed) greater then the work of creation.</p>
               <p>The more proper therefore that this worke of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is only to God, the more excellent needs muſt be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of them, that by this worke are made the children of God. According to the rareneſſe of the workeman, ſo is the worke it ſelfe eſteemed.</p>
               <p>If but one man in a country, or in a kingdome, can doe ſome ſpeciall worke, in what eſtimation is the worke it ſelfe? what then ſhall wee ſay of this worke of regeneration, and of making the ſonnes of men the ſonnes of God, which none can doe in the world, but only one euen God himſelfe?

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S in the former Chapter the dignity of Gods children hath been declared by the excellency of God who is their Father, as alſo by this, that God only hath begotten them againe vnto himſelfe, and that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can worke the worke of our regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo now to ſet foorth the ſame further by the firſt and principall cauſe thereof, viz. by that which firſt mooued God ſo to regenerate and adopt vs vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, let vs a little more conſider of the infinit loue of his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs in this behalfe, whereof before we haue heard, euen that that loue is the principall cauſe of our adoption and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</p>
               <p>This loue of God is here to be conſidered two waies. Firſt, as the cauſe of election before the foundations of the world were layd, both to adoption, whereof now we ſpeake: and alſo to the fruition of all other mercies in this life and the life to come. Secondly, as it was afterward in the fulneſſe of time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, by the ſending ſpecially of his ſonne into the world, for the effecting of that our adoption.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt, it hath been before noted, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in this very place, ſpeaking of the loue of God as of the cauſe of making vs his children, doth not ſpeake in the time preſent, but in the time paſt, by that circumſtance of time ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the ſaid loue of God, not to be a new loue, or a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent loue only, but an ancient loue, euen from the beginning. The ſame (beſides the Scriptures before alledged) is expreſly teſtified by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who not only ſaith that <hi>God hath elected vs before the foundation of the world,</hi> but alſo touching the cauſe and the end of our ſaid election, hee addeth, that <hi>God hath then predeſtinated vs to be adopted,</hi> (or to bee made children) <hi>through Ieſus Chriſt vnto himſelfe, according to the good
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18428:36"/> pleaſure of his will, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 5. that is, according to his meere and moſt free grace, without reſpect of any worthineſſe of them, whom he hath choſen: and the words following of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall end of our election, viz. <hi>the praiſe of the glory of his grace,</hi> do further manifeſt his free grace to haue beene the principall cauſe of election to adoption, and to the ſonneſhip (if I may ſo ſpeake) of God. For if there were any other principall cauſe thereof then only Gods free grace, then alſo the praiſe of the ſaid cauſe ſhould be the end of our election, as well as the praiſe of the free grace of God.</p>
               <p>As alſo it is ſaid, that God choſe the children of Iſrael to be his ſpeciall people, becauſe only <hi>he loued their fathers, Deut.</hi> 4. 37. and as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaith, <hi>it had pleaſed the Lord to make them his people, 1. Sam.</hi> 12. 22. inſinuating by that phraſe, the meere plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God to haue bin the cauſe of making them his people: ſo and much more may be ſaid touching our adoption to bee the children of God. Yea, ſo alſo it is ſaid, <hi>that God of his own will hath begotten vs againe, &amp;c.</hi> that is, of his meer loue, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
               <p>As this loue of God (afterward declared by the act it ſelfe, of adopting vs to be his children) was thus eternall without beginning, ſo alſo it is eternall in reſpect it ſhalbe without end: Therefore it is called <hi>euerlaſting loue, Ierem.</hi> 31. 3. and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that <hi>whom God loueth once he loueth to the end: Iohn</hi> 13. 1. And indeed whatſoeuer is without beginning, is alſo without end. Many things haue beginning, which ſhall haue no end, as all Angels good and bad, and the ſpirits of all men: but nothing ſhall haue end, that hath no beginning. Therefore as before we heard that all that are regenerated haue beene beloued of God without beginning of his loue, ſo <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith that ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are kept by <hi>the power of God vnto ſaluation, &amp;c. 1. Pet.</hi> 1. 5. But of this before, Chap. 2. Neither only is that loue of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the regenerated euerlaſting and without end, becauſe it is without beginning: but for the ſame reaſon alſo it is the more free and without all reſpect of any worthineſſe in them that are without beginning beloued. For how can they pretend any worthines in themſelues to haue beene the cauſe of that loue, that was more ancient then themſelues, yea then the world? The cauſe muſt be before the effect, and not the effect
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18428:36"/> before the cauſe. In this reſpect therefore the dignity of Gods children is ſo much the greater; firſt becauſe they are beloued of God: ſecondly becauſe they haue been ſo long beloued of God: thirdly, becauſe they haue been and are freely beloued of God: fourthly becauſe the loue of God is euerlaſting. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt; if the <hi>fauor of a king be as the dew vpon the graſſe, Pro.</hi> 19. 12. and if <hi>in the light of a Kings countenance be life, and his fauour be like a cloud of the latter raine, Pro.</hi> 16. 15. what ſhall we ſay of the fauor of God, and of the light of his countenance that is king of kings?</p>
               <p>The ſame is to be ſaid of the antiquity of Gods loue. For as it is the greater grace and honor for a ſubiect, the longer he hath been in fauor with his Prince; ſo likewiſe that all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God haue been ſo long in fauour with God, and that God hath ſo long loued them, it cannot but be the greater honor vnto them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the freeneſſe of Gods loue without reſpect of any deſert in his children, doth as much dignifie his ſaid childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the free grace of a Prince without any deſert or gifts, whereby to procure the Princes fauor, doth the more honor ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect as is in ſuch free fauour with his Soueraigne.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and principally the loue of God is the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable in reſpect that it is euerlaſting, becauſe we ſee the grace and fauour of all Princes to be mutable. Though <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> were in ſuch grace with <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> that hee procured him to write his royall letters for the deſtruction of all the Iewes: yet we know what a change fell out afterward. Yea, how ſoone and vpon how light an occaſion (euen vpon the falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port only of flattering <hi>Ziba)</hi> was the great loue of <hi>Dauid</hi> qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led towards <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> the ſonne of his ancient and moſt faithfull friend <hi>Ionathan?</hi> Sith therefore the loue of mortall Princes is ſo vncertaine, it cannot but be the greater honor to the children of God, that they are ſo rooted and grounded in grace and fauor with God, that nothing whatſoeuer ſhall euer bee able to diſgrace them with him, ſo as that he ſhall for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer caſt them off. But this ſhall further appeare by other things, afterward handled concerning their further digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. All this of the loue of God, of his ancient loue, and of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18428:37"/> his free loue, and of his vnchangeable loue towards his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is the more honor vnto them, becauſe as it is ſaid, <hi>Iacob haue I loued and Eſau haue I hated: Rom.</hi> 9. 17. ſo it is ſaid that <hi>the Lord hateth all the workers of iniquity. Pſal.</hi> 5. 5. and <hi>that his face is againſt them that do euill, to cut off their remembrance from the earth. Pſal.</hi> 34. 16. And therefore the wicked haue no part in the foreſaid loue of God, but it is proper and peculiar only to the children of God. And thus we ſee, that the foreſaid loue of God towards his children is not only to be conſidered as the principall and firſt mouing cauſe of their regeneration: but alſo as a ſingular, and moſt honourable benefit and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. Thus much for the firſt conſideration of the loue of God in making vs his children, viz. as it was the cauſe of our election at the firſt, euen before all times, vnto our adoption and regeneration to be made in time. Touching the ſecond conſideration of Gods loue in making vs his children, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it hath been declared particularly, in giuing his ſonne for the effecting of our adoption whereunto we were predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and elected, it is ſaid, <hi>So God loued the world, that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his only begotten ſonne, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhould not periſh, &amp;c. Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. If God ſo loued the world that he ſent his ſonne, that men might haue euerlaſting life by beleeuing in him, then alſo in his ſaid loue he ſent his ſonne to adopt them vnto God. For none can beleeue but ſuch as are adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and haue the ſpirit of adoption, whereby to beleeue God to be their father. And adoption is one neceſſary ſtep to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life: and without adoption and regeneration, can no man enter into the kingdome of heauen, as our Sauiour tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in the ſame chapter.</p>
               <p>Neither is it only manifeſt thus by conſequence, that God ſo loued the world, (that is, the elect men in the world) that he ſent his ſonne for their adoption, but the Apoſtle doth alſo teach the ſame expreſly; <hi>When the fulneſſe of time</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was come, God ſent his ſonne made of a woman, and made vnder the law,</hi> (that is, not only borne in the time of the law, but alſo made ſubiect both to the obedience and to the curſe of the law) <hi>that he might redeeme them that were vnder the law, that they might receiue the adoption of ſonnes. Galat.</hi> 4. 4. 6.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:18428:37"/>
               <p>By theſe teſtimonies it is manifeſt, not only that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his great loue towards vs in ſending his own and only ſonne into the world, to make vs his children, but that alſo God the ſonne was a principall agent in the work of our adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and regeneration, as well as God the father: and that wee could no more haue been made the children of God without the worke of God the ſonne, then without the worke of God the father.</p>
               <p>The ſame is yet further manifeſt, by the Euangeliſts inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the propheticall words of <hi>Caiph as</hi> ſpoken as hee was high Prieſt, touching the neceſſity of the death of one for the people, and that the whole nation <hi>ſhould not periſh,</hi> For this (ſaith the Euangeliſt) <hi>ſpake hee not of himſelfe, but being high Prieſt that ſame yeere, he prophecied that Ieſus ſhould die for that nation: and not for that nation only, but that he ſhould gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the children of God that were ſcattered. Ioh.</hi> 11. 50. By ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together he meaneth adopting: and <hi>by the children of God</hi> he meaneth not them that were already in act the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, but that were appointed and predeſtinated ſo to be, as before we heard. It is alſo in the ſaid place to be obſerued <note place="margin">Note.</note> that he ſpeaketh not paſſiuely, but actiuely. He ſaith not, <hi>that the children of God might be gathered together,</hi> but he ſaith that <hi>he might gather together, &amp;c.</hi> So he noteth that the gathering together and adopting of the children of God, is a worke of Ieſus Chriſt as well as of God the father. The ſame our Sauiour himſelfe teſtifieth, ſaying: <hi>Other ſheepe I haue alſo which are not of this fold, them alſo must I bring. Ioh.</hi> 10. 16. he ſaith not they ſhall be brought, but that he himſelfe muſt bring them. <hi>Peter</hi> accordeth with both the former teſtimonies, making this to be the end of <hi>Christs ſuffering once for ſinnes, &amp;c.</hi> not that we might be brought only to God, but alſo that he might bring vs vnto God. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. As therefore we could not haue been ſaued without Chriſt, ſo neither could we haue been adopted without him.</p>
               <p>Therefore alſo, as before we heard the dignity of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to be the greater by the worke of the father, ſo it is alſo the greater hereby, that the father worketh herein by the ſonne: and the ſonne worketh with the father as well in this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18428:38"/> our ſecond creation as in the firſt: For Chriſt is the ſame in glory and excellency with the Father. Whatſoeuer is ſpoken of the Father (according to the Deity) the ſame may alſo be ſayd of the ſonne. For <hi>I</hi> (ſaith Chriſt himſelfe) <hi>and my Father are one. Ioh.</hi> 10. 30. and the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>hee being in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to be equall with God. Philip.</hi> 2. 6. And he is called <hi>the heire of all things, by whom God the Father made the world: and the brightneſſe of the glory, and the ingraued forme of his fathers perſon. Heb.</hi> 1. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>Neither was Chriſt only ſo excellent as he was God: but he was alſo very excellent in his humanity: the ſame being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the wombe of a virgin by the immediat operation of the holy ghoſt; and being perſonally vnited to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, that both natures might make one perſon; and ſo vnited, being alſo altogether without ſinne, vnſpotted, vndefiled, moſt holy and righteous. In his offices alſo he was moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable: being the onely King, Prieſt, and Prophet of his Church: yea, ſuch a King, Prieſt, and Prophet, as of whom <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> and all their kingly poſterity, with the Prieſts of the law, and the Prophets extraordinarily raiſed vp and ſent to the ancient people of God, were but types, figures and ſhadowes.</p>
               <p>The more excellent therefore that Chriſt is and was before his ſending into the world and afterward, the more hath God dignified his children, in ſending him ſo into the world to make them his children. The more honorable perſons that any Prince doth imploy for the good of any other, the more is he dignified and graced, for whoſe good ſuch honourable perſons are ſo imployed.</p>
               <p>Did not <hi>Balak</hi> King of <hi>Moab,</hi> much honour <hi>Balaam</hi> by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto him, firſt ſome of the Elders and Princes of <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Midian: Num.</hi> 22. 5. 7. and 13. and afterward more Princes and more honorable then the former? verſ. 15.</p>

               <p>If the ſending of ſuch honourable meſſengers were ſome honour to them to whom they were ſent, what ſhall we thinke of Gods ſending his owne ſonne to vs, and for vs, to make vs his children?

Heb.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>This is ſo much the more, becauſe God ſent not his ſonne in glory, and to liue here in glory, but in baſeneſſe and in forme of a ſeruant, cloathed with our baſe nature (yet purged from all corruption as ſoone as it was ſeparated in the wombe of the Virgin to be that which afterward it was) and ſo to liue a while in pouerty, in ſhame, and in all contempt, and at the laſt to be put to the moſt ſhamefull death of the croſſe, as though he had been a worme and no man; or as though he had been the vileſt man, that had before come into the world.</p>
               <p>Were it not a very great honor to a poore, yea, to a trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſubiect, being ſomewhere in captiuity, bondage, and great miſery, if his Prince ſhould abaſe his only ſonne, and ſend him diſguiſed in baſe apparell, and to vndergoe much po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty and other hardneſſe, with ſhame alſo and contempt for a time, for the redeeming the ſaid ſubiect and to bring him home to the Court of the Prince, there to eat meat with the Prince his ſonne, and to be accounted as a companion of his? How great then, is this honour that God hath done vnto vs in ſending his own ſonne, and in expoſing him to many, (yea to all) indignities <hi>to redeeme vs that we might receiue the adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſonnes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I proceed any further, let me here inſert another principall cauſe of our regeneration, viz. the mercy of God.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18428:39"/> This may ſeeme to be all one with the loue of God, before handled. And indeed it is ſo like thereunto, that it is often confounded therewith: ſo that the word loue is often taken for mercy: and mercy is often taken for loue, when there is ſpeech of the dealing of God with men: eſpecially in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of election, calling and ſaluation. This may be obſerued in diuers places before alledged, and therefore I ſtand not vpon it. But although there be great ſimilitude betwixt them, yet <note place="margin">Note.</note> they are alſo to be diſtinguiſhed. For firſt of all both are in God towards man, but both cannot be in man towards God. Loue may be and muſt be in man towards God: but it is very abſurd to ſay that a man may ſhew mercy vnto God. Againe the loue of God hath reſpect vnto vs as being only the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God; euen baſe creatures, ſuch as were altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſo great honour of being made the children of God. But the mercy of God hath reſpect and relation vnto vs, not only as we are creatures, baſe, and vnworthy of the foreſayd loue, but alſo as we were miſerable, eſpecially polluted with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> yea, dead in all ſinnes and treſpaſſes; more then vnworthy of his fauour, euen ſuch as had deſerued his euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting diſpleaſure and indignation: as hauing been traitors and rebells againſt him in the higheſt degree. Furthermore, the loue of God is in order before the ſending or giuing of Chriſt, being the cauſe both of our election, and alſo of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or giuing Chriſt Ieſus as hath beene ſhewed touching e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection out of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 5. 6. and touching the ſending of Chriſt out of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. But the mercy of God is only in Chriſt Ieſus, and for Chriſt Ieſus his ſake, as afterward ſhall appeare.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is ſaid that we are elected in Chriſt, that is not to be vnderſtood ſimply of election itſelfe, but rather of the ends whereto we are elected, viz. adoption and ſaluation. To ſpeake ſimply of election itſelfe, it was meerly of the free loue of God, and the efficient cauſe thereof was only in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And ſo God hauing eternally decreed our ſaluation, did alſo at the ſame inſtant decree the meanes of our ſaluation; namely the giuing of his only ſonne to be made man for vs. We were firſt in order elected to be ſaued, and then Chriſt was appointed and at the ſame inſtant deſtinated, to be the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18428:39"/> perſon by whom we ſhould be ſaued. Therefore, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith that the Iewes had <hi>put Chriſt to death by the determinate counſell and foreknowledge of God, Acts</hi> 2. 23. ſo he calleth Chriſt <hi>alambe vnſpotted, &amp;c. ordained before the foundations of the world, 1. Pet. 1. 20.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this priority of decreeing our ſaluation, before the ſending of Chriſt was decreed, muſt be vnderſtood of a priority in order in the nature of things, not of a priority in time. For both being eternall and before all times, (to wit the decree for ſauing vs, and the decree for ſending Chriſt to worke out that ſaluation for vs) one could not bee before an other in time. For in things eternall, there can be neither pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority, or poſteriority in time. Thus then we ſee a plaine diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt the loue of God, and the mercy of God, either in our election, or in the worke of regeneration, or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing.</p>
               <p>That the mercy of God was one of the principall mouing cauſes of our regeneration, viz. which moued God to worke this worke in vs, it is manifeſt alſo by the teſtimony of <hi>Peter.</hi> For he in his firſt Epiſtle and Chapter, hauing after his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall maner ſaluted the Chriſtians to whom he wrote, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this entrance into the reſt of the Epiſtle, ſaying: <hi>Bleſſed be God the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who according to his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant</hi> (or rich) <hi>mercy hath begotten vs againe, &amp;c. 1. Pet.</hi> 1. 3. Is it not in theſe words plaine, that the Apoſtle doth make the mercy of God a principall cauſe firſt mouing God to beget vs againe? So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the worke of our ſaluation ioineth together <hi>the mercy of God, and the waſhing of the new birth, Tit.</hi> 3. 5. So alſo particularly ſpeaking of his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion from blaſpheming, and from perſecuting and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of the Church, to the true feare of God, and loue of his Saints, he attributeth the ſame to the mercy of God, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>I was a blaſphemer, and a perſecuter, and an oppreſſor, but I was receiued to mercy,</hi> or <hi>I found mercy.</hi> By the mercy of God here, I vnderſtand the pity and compaſſion that God tooke vpon vs beholding vs in our miſerable ſtate by nature, being blind, deafe, dumb, lame, ſicke, dead, &amp;c. (as hath been ſaid) and ſo his bowels of compaſſion being moued towards vs, and neuer
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18428:40"/> ceaſing to worke (as it were) in him till by the worke of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation he had releaſed and diſcharged vs from our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid miſerable ſtate and condition. I might ſpeake in this place of the mercy of God in forgiuing our ſinnes: but becauſe I ſhall ſpeake afterward of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes amongſt the benefits belonging to the children of God by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God: therefore I will ſpare all ſpeech thereof here. In the meane time that God hath ſhewed ſuch mercy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, as to make them his children, it cannot but adde ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to their dignity. For as it is a great preferment to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of God, he being the King of kings: ſo it is no leſſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſuch miſerable, yea, rebellious and traiterous creatures, as we were, to find ſuch mercy with God, as not only to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned of all our ſinnes, but alſo to be made his children: yea, this is the greater matter, becauſe it is a ſpeciall teſtimony of the loue of God before handled. For if he had not loued vs full dearely, he would neuer haue ſhewed ſuch compaſſion vpon vs.</p>

For after the ſaid <note place="margin">Note.</note> praier he did not only rebuke <hi>Peter</hi> for going about to reſcue him (as was ſaid) by ſmiting off the high Prieſts ſeruants eare: neither did he onely heale him whom <hi>Peter</hi> had ſo maimed, the better to ſhew that he neither had pleaſure in <hi>Peters</hi> raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, neither had any ſpleen againſt the ſaid high Prieſts ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant that had come out with other to apprehend him: but he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18428:41"/> did further alſo tell him, that <hi>if he would</hi> he could by his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to his father haue obtained <hi>more then twelue legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to take him from them.</hi> Who then had laid their hands vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him? <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 53. Doth not this moſt plainly teſtifie that he did all moſt willingly? Doubtleſſe it doth. For otherwiſe he could as eaſily haue auoided, yea and confounded all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany though comming foorth with ſwords <hi>and ſtanes to take him, as by telling</hi> them that he was the man they ſought for, he made them to <hi>goe backward and to fall to the ground. Ioh.</hi> 18. 6.</p>
               <p>By theſe things therfore, that God ſo loued vs, that to make vs his children, he ſent his owne ſonne, and that in forme of a ſeruant, yea, and worſe then a ſeruant vnto wretched men (not for doing any thing (as <hi>Paul</hi> for biddeth vs to be the ſeruants of men. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23.) but for ſuffering any thing at their hands: And that the ſonne himſelfe did alſo this moſt willingly and cheerfully without any conſtraint, doth it not manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that the adoption of the children is much graced and honored?</p>
               <p>Yea certainly, the more is that their adoption to be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God graced and honored by all things before ſpoken of, becauſe as Chriſt was therefore ſent, and did therefore come, and being come did alſo willingly vndergoe and ſuffer all, ſo alſo he did effect that, which was ſo the end of his ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comming, and ſuffering. For ſo it is ſaid of him (not of the father) that <hi>as many as receiued him, to them he gaue prerogatiue to be the ſonnes of God;</hi> (or <hi>to be the children of God) euen to them that beleeued in his name: Ioh.</hi> 1. 12. And ſo although it be ſaid in one reſpect that <hi>he is not aſhamed to call vs brethren, Heb.</hi> 2. 11. yet both in the ſame place verſ. 10. in another reſpect he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated alſo to be our father, in that it is ſaid, <hi>that he brought many children vnto glory.</hi> and alſo he is expreſly intituled by the name of <hi>Euerlaſting father: Iſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi> 9. 6. Moreouer by theſe things thus written, it is moſt apparant, that Chriſt hath not onely made vs the children of God, but alſo that he hath paid full deerely for our ſaid adoption. Therefore it is ſaid that we <hi>are bought with a price, 1. Cor.</hi> 6. 20. and 7. 23. and this price was not any <hi>corruptible thing, as ſiluer or go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18428:41"/> thoſe his dreadfull ſufferings before mentioned. If God had ſent all the Angels of heauen and they had taken our nature vpon them, and therein had ſhed their bloud for vs, it had been nothing to the blood of Chriſt: becauſe Chriſt was the Lord of the Angels, and all <hi>the Angels were to worſhip him. Heb.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
               <p>But to leaue that which was not, and to returne to that which was, it is much, and exceeding much, that God hath honored mankind, eſpecially his children, by giuing vnto them all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures, to be killed for preſeruation of their preſent life. Much more then is this honor (and ten times greater then the heart of man can conceiue) that God <hi>hath not ſpared his owne ſonne, but giuen him to the death. Rom.</hi> 8. 32. (yea, to ſuch a death as he ſuffered, euen the curſed death of the Croſſe) that being dead in ſinnes we might <hi>be made aliue. Epheſ.</hi> 2. 5. and ſo <hi>receiue the promiſe</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit. Gal.</hi> 3. 14. where by to call God our father, and to be called the children of God.</p>
               <p>This were a worthy meditation, euery time we ſee ſheepe or lamb, or pigeon, or chicken, or any thing els, by butcher, or by any other body, to be killed for vs; it were (I ſay) a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy meditation, if then we could thinke and ſay, This is a great honor of God towards vs, that this innocent and harmeleſſe creature muſt die to preſerue vs aliue. But (O Lord) how haſt thou honored vs, by giuing thy ſonne, thy only ſonne, thy ſonne whom thou louedſt moſt deerely, euen as thy owne ſoule, thy ſonne Ieſus, to be ſlaine, and to ſuffer more then a thouſand bodily deaths, to make vs thy children, that ſo we might liue in thy ſight!</p>
               <p>Did not <hi>Abraham</hi> greatly honor God, when he was ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>to take now</hi> (without delay or any ſtay for iſſue of him) his ſonne, his only ſonne, his ſonne <hi>Iſaack</hi> (in whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made of bleſſing for all nations) his ſonne whom he loued moſt tenderly, (not only for natures ſake, but alſo for the promiſe ſake) and to goe to the land of <hi>Moriah</hi> (an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known country) and to offer him (that is, to kill him with his own hands, not to giue him to another to be offered and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) <hi>for a burnt offring</hi> (an honourable but an hard and wofull kind of death, for the naturall father to put his own naturall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18428:42"/> ſonne vnto) <hi>vpon one of the mountaines which God ſhould ſhew him Geneſ.</hi> 22. 2. (he could not tell where) did not <hi>Abraham</hi> (I ſay) greatly honor God, by being willing and ready to doe it; and by going ſo farre in the doing of it, that the knife was in his hand to haue killed his owne ſonne vpon Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in that behalfe; and that therefore he had done it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if God himſelfe had not countermanded him, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it? Doubtleſſe <hi>Abraham</hi> did ſo thereby honour God, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith in that behalfe hath beene the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned and honorable euer ſithence, and ſhall be renowned and honorable to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>How then hath God honored vs by giuing his ſonne for vs? and how hath Chriſt Ieſus honoured vs by giuing and offring vp himſelfe <hi>a ſweet ſmelling ſauour</hi> and ſacrifice to God for vs, that did by our ſinnes ſtinke moſt noy ſomely in the noſtrills of God? <hi>Abraham</hi> had receiued his ſonne from God: God had not receiued his ſonne from vs. <hi>Abraham</hi> might haue had an other ſonne from God, as well as he had <hi>Iſaak:</hi> God could not haue an other beſides Chriſt. <hi>Abraham</hi> did owe his ſonne, and all that he had; yea, himſelfe alſo to God: God oweth nothing to vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> had a commandement to offer his ſonne <hi>Iſaak</hi> vnto God. Had God any commandement, or could any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand God to giue his ſonne vnto vs and for vs. <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſonne both were to dy at the laſt. The ſonne of God was as immortall and free from death as God himſelfe, becauſe he was God with his father. <hi>Abraham</hi> had had his ſonne but a while: but God had had his ſonne from all eternity. <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſonne was like to himſelfe but in part: Gods ſonne was perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly and fully like vnto him.</p>
               <p>In all theſe reſpects and in diuers other, we plainly ſee how much more God hath honored vs by giuing his ſonne, as alſo how much more Chriſt hath honoured vs by giuing himſelfe for vs, then <hi>Abraham</hi> honored God, by giuing his ſonne vnto God, that had firſt giuen him to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe were it not a great honour to any poore and baſe ſubiect &amp;c. being in miſerable bondage and captiuity (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaid) for his Prince being wiſe and knowing what he
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18428:42"/> doth, or for ſuch a ſonne of ſuch a Prince to giue a very great price for his ranſome? who then can expreſſe the honor that Chriſt Ieſus hath done to vs, in that being <hi>the ſonne of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tender and deere vnto him</hi> (as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelfe in reſpect both of his father and mother. <hi>Pro.</hi> 4. 3.) and being euen the <hi>ſonne of his fathers deſires</hi> (as <hi>Bethſheba</hi> ſpake of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and to <hi>Salomon. Pro.</hi> 31. 2.) and being <hi>full of wiſedome and grace, Luk</hi> 2. 40. and being the wiſedome of his father <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 44. <hi>And hauing all treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge hid in him, Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 3. who (I ſay) can expreſſe the honor that Chriſt Ieſus, being ſuch as he is and alwaies was, hath done vnto vs in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a greater price for our ranſome and adoption to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then all the kingdomes of the world (ten thouſand times told) are worth? For do we not account of all things, according to the price that wiſe men doe giue for them? Is then the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption of Gods children lightly to be accounted, for which Chriſt gaue as great a price as for our ſaluation? This of the price which Chriſt hath giuen to make vs the children of God, is the more, becauſe he gaue not the ſame price or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for to redeeme the Angels <hi>(that kept not their ſtanding) that they might with vs receiue the adoption of ſonnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before their fall they were ſo much more glorious then man before his fall, by how much more their habitation and employment in heauen, was more glorious then <hi>Adams</hi> in earth: yet, hath Chriſt Ieſus, in making in vs his children alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether paſſed them ouer: <hi>and they are ſtill reſerued in euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting chaines vnder darkneſſe, vnto the iudgement of the great day. Iude</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>How greatly therefore hath Chriſt honoured vs by giuing ſuch a price to make vs the children of God, who dwell in houſes of clay, and who touching part of vs are but wormes meat, whereas he hath giuen none at all, for them that before their fall, were moſt glorious ſpirits, dwelling with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in heauen?</p>
               <p>Becauſe alſo the holy ghoſt is of the ſame glory and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency with God the father, and God the ſonne, therefore the worke of the holy ghoſt in our adoption is likewiſe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with the worke of the father and of the ſonne. For the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18428:43"/> father and the ſonne worke not without the holy ghoſt. As in the firſt creation it is ſaid that <hi>the ſpirit of God moued vpon the waters, or ſate vpon the waters,</hi> and vpon the whole matter of all things before created (euen as a bird ſitteth vpon her egs) to bring the ſaid firſt matter into forme and faſhion, and ſo did immediatly execute that in the firſt creation which God the father had decreed, and which God the ſonne had ſpoken concerning the ſaid creation: ſo in our ſecond creation and adoption God the father and God the ſonne work not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly but by God the holy ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The ſame holy ghoſt alſo is he, by whom the comming of Chriſt into the world, his death, and other things he ſuffered, euen the whole price which hee gaue of his actiue and paſſiue obedience for vs, is applied vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour likewiſe attributeth our regeneration to the ſpirit, as well as it is elſewhere aſcribed to the father: <hi>Except a man be borne of water, and of the ſpirit, &amp;c. That which is borne of the fleſh is fleſh, and that that is borne of the ſpirit is ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi> and againe, <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it commeth, nor whither it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; ſo is euery man that is borne of the ſpirit. Ioh.</hi> 3. 5. 6. 7. 8.</p>
               <p>Yea the ſpirit of God ſeemeth to be that very <hi>immortall ſeed of our new birth</hi> whereof <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. I know that other doe interpret the word to be that immortall ſeed there ſpoken of, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>not of mortall, but of immortall ſeede, by the word.</hi> Notwithſtanding to me it ſeemeth otherwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle changeth the firſt prepoſition <hi>(of)</hi> vſed in the firſt place, into another, viz. into <hi>(by)</hi> vſed in the ſecond place in ſpeaking of the word. And therefore I doe rather thinke the <hi>word</hi> there to be noted, as the inſtrument onely, whereby that immortall ſeed of our new birth before ſpoken of, is conueied into vs. This (I ſay) I doe the rather thinke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the change of prepoſitions, the Apoſtle not ſaving, <hi>being borne anew, not of mortall, but immortall ſeed of the word, but</hi> ſaying in this laſt clauſe, <hi>by the word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, I am, and ſhall be the more fully perſwaded of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation to be the right (till I ſhall heare, or ſee better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then I haue done for the former) becauſe of the places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18428:43"/> alleged, to proue our regeneration to be of the ſpirit of God, as well as of the father, and of the ſonne, and becauſe the prepoſition <hi>of,</hi> firſt vſed in that place of <hi>Peter,</hi> is ſo conſtantly vſed in all the former places concerning the ſpirit, viz. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 13. and 3. verſ. 5. 6. and 8.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge the word to be called ſeed, in reſpect <hi>of the fruits of righteouſneſſe, Luk.</hi> 8. 11. but for the reaſons before alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, I cannot yet thinke it to be there vnderſtood for the ſeed of our regeneration, any otherwiſe then it is the inſtrument of conueying the ſpirit of God into vs.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the ſpirit is called <hi>the ſpirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba father,</hi> that is, whereby we call God our father, and whereby we are called the children of God. Yea, it is further ſaid, <hi>that the ſame ſpirit beareth witneſſe to our ſpirits that we are the children of God: Rom.</hi> 8. 15. 16.</p>
               <p>So then the holy ghoſt doth both immediatly beget vs to God, and is alſo a witneſſe of that our begetting again to God, and of our being the children of God. But I will ſtay no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in this point. To conclude therefore all the former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hitherto vſed for the dignity of Gods children; ſith they haue ſo honourable a father, and ſith their adoption is thus honored, with the worke of all the three perſons in the Deity; and ſith the originall cauſe of the ſaid adoption is both the free loue of God the father in ſending his owne and onely ſonne; and of the ſonne in comming ſo willingly and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe ſo cheerfully to ſo baſe a condition for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of the ſaid adoption; and ſith alſo he gaue ſo great a price for it, it cannot be, but the worke it ſelfe is very honorable.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, that they that be againe ſo regenerated of him, and by him, by whom they were at the firſt made, haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a new ſtate and condition, and are not as they were, of the world worldly, of the earth earthly, and of fleſh fleſhly: but of heauen heauenly: of God the father <hi>(of whom the whole family in heauen and in earth is named Epheſ.</hi> 3. 15.) called his children; of Chriſt denominated <hi>Chriſtians, Acts</hi> 19. 26. and of the ſpirit ſaid to be <hi>ſpirituall, 1. Cor.</hi> 2. 15. So they are not only humane, by the humane nature, but alſo diuine by participation of the diuine nature: 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. not touching their ſubſtance, but
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18428:44"/> touching diuine qualities and operations.</p>
               <p>Such therefore, and only ſuch may truly ſpeake of nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For only they may moſt truly ſay, they are borne of God, as we haue ſeen before, chap. 2. 29. and as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh afterward chap. 4. 7. And they onely may moſt truly alſo ſay further, <hi>that they are the generation of God, Acts</hi> 17. 28. and that in ſuch maner, as that thereby they are citizens of heauen, and inhabitants together with the glorious Angels: as afterward we ſhall heare more at large.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of this nobility, and without this, all other nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is nothing in Gods ſight. Yea, that which our Sauior ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Iewes particularly, may be ſaid generally of al that are not the children of God, <hi>They do the works of their father the diuell and the luſts of their father they will doe Iohn</hi> 8. 41. 44. Not much vnlike alſo is that deſcription of <hi>the King that is the ſonne of nobles, that eat in time for ſtrength, and not for drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 17. For what doth <hi>Salomon</hi> by this deſcription teach els, but that ſuch kings are moſt renowned and noble, which doe adorne their kingly deſcent with true piety and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety? And though <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeake but of <hi>eating in time for ſtrength and not for drunkenneſſe;</hi> yet by this one vertue hee meaneth all other. And of this vertue he maketh choice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue other, becauſe it is in a manner the rareſt of all other, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in kings. It is hard to find any man that hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, to be ſober and moderate in the vſe of meats &amp; drinke, and to eat both only in time, and alſo for ſtrength, not for exceſſe, and pleaſure. I may alſo apply to this purpoſe, that which is ſaid by the Prophet, which confoundeth them that are <hi>excellent or noble in the earth with the Saints, and the Saints with them, Pſal.</hi> 16. 3. thereby teaching, that the Saints onely haue the beſt excellency and nobility, and that none may rightly be called excellent or noble, but ſuch as are Saints. And indeed ſeeing all that are not ſanctified, cannot but be of the diuell as doing his works, what greater baſeneſſe, vileneſſe, and ignobility can there be then to be ſuch? Seeing therefore theſe things are ſo, who ſeeth not but that the ſtate of Gods children is much dignified thereby? For who doth not highly account of nobility? what ſtriuing, what labouring, ſometime
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18428:44"/> alſo what offering and paying is there for it? For it? For what? Euen for names and titles of nobility, which earthly Princes haue in their power to beſtow? what ſtriuing then, what labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and what praying, (in ſtead of paying) ought there to be for that nobility, which only commeth from the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth? Nobles here of the world ſit with Princes of the world in their Parliaments, to make lawes for the gouernment of other. But it is better to receiue lawes from God then to make lawes for men: and it is much better for a man to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne himſelfe, then without that to preſcribe and giue lawes for the gouernment of other. Laſt of all we ſhall heare after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that the leaſt of Gods children ſhall ſit in greater place with Chriſt Ieſus, euen to iudge the world, in his heauenly Parliament, then the greateſt nobles that euer were in the earth did euer ſit with any earthly Prince, in their earthly parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thus much for this point.</p>

This point I will diſpatch very briefly that I may the more haſten to other things. Touching this therefore, though God himſelfe (I meane Father, Sonne, and holy ghoſt) bee the onely authors of our regeneration, yet we heard before, that men are the inſtruments of God, whereby the immortall ſeed of our new birth is conueied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, for the effecting of our ſayd new birth. Theſe are chiefly the miniſters of the word, touching whome, as wee haue heard, the Apoſtle ſaith that ſome plant, and other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but that God giueth increaſe; ſo hee alſo ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and all other that they are labourers together with God.</p>

               <p>For what doth <hi>the glad tidings of peace</hi> there meane, but the preaching of the Goſpell, which is the doctrine of our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to God, and of our peace made with God <hi>by Ieſus Christ, by whom it pleaſed the Father to reconcile all things vnto himſelfe, and to ſet at peace through the bloud of his Croſſe, both the things in earth, and the things in heauen?

               <p>As the miniſtery of the Law may be called the miniſtery of wrath, becauſe it diſcouereth our ſinnes, whereby we deſerue the wrath of God, and ſo it teſtifieth the wrath of God, (in which reſpect <hi>Ioſias</hi> at the finding of the book of the Law, that had bin long hid, is ſayd to haue rent his clothes, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 11. as perceiuing thereby the tranſgreſſions of the people, and the wrath of God hanging ouer their heads for the ſame) as (I ſay) the Law in that reſpect may ie called the miniſtery of wrath becauſe it teſtifieth and ſheweth the wrath of God prouoked by mens ſinnes againſt the Law: ſo the goſpell may be and is called the goſpell or <hi>the glad tidings of peace;</hi> not only becauſe it maketh peace here below betwixt man and man, &amp; betwixt man and other creatures, <hi>Iſa</hi> 11. 6. &amp;c. and in man <note place="margin">Note.</note> likewiſe towards God, making them as meeke as lambes that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18428:45"/> were before as fierce as Lions &amp; Tigers: but alſo becauſe it teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth God to be at peace by Ieſus Chriſt with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In this reſpect therfore, wel might the Apoſtle, &amp; wel might the Prophet ſay in commendation of the miniſters of the goſpell, <hi>How beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of ſaluation!</hi> And if their feet are to be thought ſo beautifull, much more their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The face of <hi>Moſes</hi> hauing receiued that law that is, as wee heard, the miniſtery of wrath, was ſo beautiful and did <hi>ſo ſhine,</hi> that the people could not indure the ſight thereof. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 30.</p>
               <p>Wherefore did the Lord put ſuch glory vpon the very face of <hi>Moſes?</hi> was it not to make him in reſpect of his miniſtery, the more honorable with the people? What then is to be ſaid of the miniſters of the Goſpell in the former reſpect?</p>
               <p>Before the comming of Chriſt, prophets that were ſent to call men to repentance, (the firſt ſtep of the children of God and the beginning of their regeneration) prophets (I ſay) ſo ſent to call men to repentance by denouncing the iudgments of God againſt them, were ſo honorable that both God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ioyned the regard of them with the regard of kings, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and doe my prophets no harme. Pſal.</hi> 105. 15. and alſo that kings were glad of their company, <hi>for the honoring of them before their people: 1. Sam. 15. 3.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they accounted them as their fathers: 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 21. and 13. 14. yea, wicked kings did ſo account of them; as appeareth by the two former places ſpeaking of the kings of Iſrael, who after the falling away of the ten tribes from the houſe of <hi>Dauid</hi> were all euill.</p>
               <p>In the time of our Sauiour ſuch Prophets beeing in ſome ſort ceaſſed, <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> rayſed vp betwixt ſuch prophets and Euangelicall miniſters, is commended by our Sauiour in this manner; <hi>What went ye out (into the wildernes) to ſee? A reed ſhaken with the wind? but what went ye out to ſee? a man clothed in ſoft rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Behold, they that we are ſoft clothing</hi> (that is, ſuch as flant &amp; ruffle it out in ſilkes &amp; veluets, and be georgeouſly aparrelled) <hi>are in Kings houſes. But what went ye out to ſee? A Prophet? yea, I ſay vnto you, and more then a Prophet &amp;c.</hi> So our Sauiour mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth Iohn Baptiſt, not onely aboue gallant and gorgeous
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18428:46"/> courtiers, but alſo aboue the ancient Prophets: yet for al that, he commendeth the leaſt miniſter of the Goſpell aboue him, ſaying, <hi>Notwithſtanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heauen, is greater then he, Mat.</hi> 11. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11.</p>
               <p>The excellency alſo of the miniſters of the word (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Goſpell) is manifeſt by the honorable names and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles giuen vnto them by God himſelfe. For are they not called in a ſpeciall manner, <hi>the men of God? 1. Kings 13. 1. 2. Tim.</hi> 3. 17. Be they not intituled <hi>the lights of the world? Mat. 5. 14:</hi> yea, was not <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> called <hi>a burning and a ſhining candle, Ioh. 5. 35.</hi> Doth not the Apoſtle ſay of himſelfe and of other: <hi>We are Embaſſadors for Chriſt, 2. Cor. 5. 20.</hi> Be they not called <hi>the ſalt of the earth? Mat. 5. 13.</hi> becauſe by their doctrine they ſhould both ſuck out the corruption of men, and ſeaſon them (as it were) to be fit ſacrifices for God.</p>
               <p>Are not miniſters of the word, as well as Kings, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, oft times in the Prophets, as alſo in the writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, called by the names of Paſtors or ſhepheards? Are not the miniſters of the ſeuen Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> called <hi>ſtarres and Angels? Reu. 1. 20.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hath then the Lord alwaies imploied ſuch honorable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the calling of his children, that is, both in the firſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and begetting of them againe vnto himſelfe: and alſo in the feeding, nurſing, and ſtrengthning of them being ſo ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and begotten? And ſhall we thinke that the ſtate of the children of God themſelues is not likewiſe very honourable? Princes and other men of great place and wiſedome, vſe the more honorable perſons in any buſineſſe (as before vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion wee haue heard by the example of <hi>Balak</hi> King of <hi>Moab,</hi> of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> &amp;c. chap. 5.) by how much the ſeruice it ſelfe is more honourable. Shall we then thinke that the moſt high God of heauen, great in wiſedom and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, would imploy ſo honorable perſons vpon a buſineſſe not ſutable vnto them? Doubtleſſe as Princes ſending forth ſuch in Embaſſage, or employing in ſome other great ſeruice ſuch as before were not very honorable, doe therefore grace and dignifie them with ſome new honorable titles, as of Knights, whereas before they were ſcarce eſquires; or of Barons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18428:46"/> before, they were but knights; or of Earles, whereas before they were but Barons, &amp; that to this end that their ambaſſage or other works wherein they are imployed may be the more honorably accounted of, yea, and becauſe their emploiment being it ſelfe honourable, doth therefore require like honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons to be employed therein: ſo becauſe the worke of our regeneration is very honorable, and to teach all men ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably to thinke of it, therefore hath the Lord with ſuch Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles dignified and graced his ſeruants whom he doth employ to worke and effect the ſame.</p>
               <p>If any, notwithſtanding that before ſaid of the excellency and preheminence of the miniſters of the goſpell (aboue the miniſters of the Law, euen aboue the great prophets) ſhall for all that conceiue more honourably of the prophets, then of the ordinary miniſters of the goſpell (though there bee no reaſon ſo to do, becauſe as the miniſtery it ſelfe of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is more honorable then the miniſtery of law and vnder the Law, ſo the miniſters alſo of the goſpel, are in like manner to be eſteemed) let ſuch conſider alſo, that all the doctrine of the prophets is written for the begetting of the children of God in theſe dayes, as well as it was preached in thoſe dayes, for the begetting of the elect then liuing. So it is expreſſely ſayd, <hi>whatſoeuer things are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aforetime are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that we through patience &amp; comfort of the ſcriptures may haue hope. Rom. 15. 14.</hi> What hope can there be without adoption and regeneration, as ſhall afterward appeare? If then the former writings of the prophets be as well for the regeneration of children to God now, as the miniſtery of the preſent miniſters; why may not thoſe writers be as well called miniſters for vs, as they were indeed for thoſe ages wherein they liued? yea, they are ſo called; yea, they are ſayd to haue miniſtred ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for vs then for themſelues, and for other, that then liued with them.</p>
               <p>So ſayth the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> moſt expreſſely, ſpeaking of the prophets that had enquired and ſearched of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation before ſpoken of by him, and ſaying, that vnto them <hi>it was reuealed that not vnto themſelues, but vnto vs they ſhould mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the things which are now ſhewed by them that haue preached the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18428:47"/> Goſpell, &amp;c. 1. Pet. 1. 12.</hi> Theſe words are not to be taken for a ſimple deniall, as if the Prophets had not miniſtred at all vnto themſelues and to other of thoſe times, the things that were afterward preached, but rather they are comparatiuely to be vnderſtood, viz. that they did not ſo much miniſter thoſe things to them of that age, as to ſucceeding generations. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the regeneration of the children of God of theſe times, is not wrought only by the preſent miniſtery: but alſo by the miniſtery of the ancient Prophets.</p>
               <p>How honorable therefore is that ſtate and condition, for the better working whereof the Lord hath not only now gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen preſent miniſters, and graced them with honourable names, but hath alſo ſo many yeers before raiſed vp ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſons as the ancient Prophets were?</p>
               <p>With this argument from the excellency of the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall fathers of our regeneration, let vs ioyne an other the like, from the excellency of the inſtrument it ſelfe, whereby the ſaid inſtrumentall fathers doe beget vs againe vnto God, that is, from the excellency of the word of God. For this is it wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith thus: <hi>Of his owne will hath he be gotten vs againe with the word of truth, Iames 1. 18.</hi> and whereby <hi>our ſoules are renued,</hi> or <hi>reſtored, Pſal. 19. 7.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaith: <hi>In Chriſt Ieſus haue I begotten you through the Goſpell, 1. Cor. 4. 15.</hi> It is that alſo, whereby we being ſo regenerated and new borne, are fed, and nouriſhed, and doe grow to a perfect man in Chriſt Ieſus, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
               <p>This word of God is not onely excellent in reſpect of the author thereof: 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16 and reſpect of the perfect matter therein conteined, (as afterward wee ſhall heare) but alſo for theſe attributes thereof, <hi>ſure, right, pure cleane,</hi> (or <hi>cleane) true, &amp;c. Pſal. 19. 7. 8. 9.</hi> and for that it is called and is ſaid to be <hi>the ſword of the ſpirit: Epheſ. 6. 17. liuely and mighty in operation, ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perthen a two edged ſword, entring thorow, euen vnto the diuiding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder of the ſoule and the ſpirit, and of the ioynts, and of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſcerning the thoughts and intents of the heart, Heb. 4. 12.</hi> So in theſe and in other reſpects, it is ſaid to be <hi>more to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then gold, yea, then much fine gold: and to be ſweeter then the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and the hony combe, Pſal.</hi> 19. 10. 11. and 119. 14. &amp; 72. and 103.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:18428:47"/>
               <p>And as the word of God generally is thus commended ſo ſpecially the Goſpel is valued at the ſame rate, <hi>Mat. 13. 44. 45.</hi> where it is not only called by the name of the kingdome of heauen, becauſe it is <hi>the word of that kingdome, Mat.</hi> 13. 19. that is, the word whereby we attaine both vnto the kingdome of grace in this world, and alſo the kingdome of glory in the world to come, but alſo by a double parable, (for the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty thereof) it is commended to be better then all treaſures, and then all pearles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> alſo comparing the Goſpell with the law, ſaith thus: <hi>If the miniſtration of death written with letters, and ingrauen in ſtones was glorious, ſo that the children of Iſrael could not behold the face of Moſes for the glory of his countenance, &amp;c. how ſhall not the miniſtration of the ſpirit be more glorious? For if the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of condemnation was glorious, much more doth the miniſtration of righteouſneſſe exceed in glory, 2. Cor.</hi> 3. 7. 8. 9. Yea, ſo excellent alſo is the myſtery of the Goſpell, that one end thereof is ſaid to be that <hi>vnto principalities and powers in heauenly places</hi> (that is, vnto the bleſſed Angels, waiting vpon God in the heauens) <hi>might be made knowen by the Church the manifold wiſedome of God, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 10. our Sauiour alſo threatneth, that ſuch as ſhould not receiue his diſciples ſent forth by two and two, to preach for a time for preparation of the way to the Goſpell, ſhould find it harder at the day of iudgement, then the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> who had been moſt fearefully deſtroied with fire and brimſtone from heauen, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 15. The Apoſtle alſo ſpeaking comparatiuely of the puniſhment of the tranſgreſſors of the law, and of the Goſpell ſaith: <hi>If the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and euery tranſgreſſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience receiued a iuſt recompence of reward, how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſaluation, which at the firſt began to be preached by the Lord, and afterward was confirmed vnto vs by them that heard him? God bearing witneſſe thereunto both with ſignes and wonders, and diuers miracles and gifts of the holy Ghoſt? &amp;c. Heb. 2. 3. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe two places ioyntly conſidered, we haue firſt an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the excellency of the Goſpell from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the contemners thereof. For firſt if they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18428:48"/> ſo great a iudgement (not that reſiſted them, and draue them out of their countries with fire and ſword, but) that did not receiue them which were ſent only by their preaching to prepare a way for the Goſpell; then (as followeth comparatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſecond place before alleged) how much greater ſhall the puniſhment of thoſe be, that both neglect, and alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne, and perſecute the Goſpell? Doth not this comminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo great puniſhment to the neglecters and contemners of the Goſpell, much magnifie the excellency of the Goſpell?</p>
               <p>Againe, in the ſecond place before alleged, we ſee other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for the excellency thereof, viz. firſt it was firſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched (touching the cleare manifeſtation of it) not by any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, (as in former time the word had been preached) <hi>but by the Lord himſelfe,</hi> as before he had ſaid, <hi>that in theſe laſt daies God hath ſpoken vnto vs by his ſonne, Heb. 1. 1.</hi> Secondly that God himſelfe had borne witneſſe actually to the excellency thereof <hi>by ſignes &amp; wonders, &amp;c.</hi> thirdly that he alſo graced it with many <hi>gifts of the holy ghoſt,</hi> according to former prophecies in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, eſpecially that of <hi>Ioel,</hi> 2. 28. ſo applied by <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2. 17</p>
               <p>To conclude therfore this argument, ſith this word of God is ſo excellent, (whereby the regeneration of the children of God, of whom I doe now ſpeake, is at firſt wrought, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward perfected,) ſhall we not thinke, that the ſtate of ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God is alſo excellent?</p>
               <p>Do not wiſe men according to the worthineſſe of any work apply and vſe the more worthy inſtruments about the ſame? Much more therefore are we to thinke the ſame, of the moſt wiſe God.</p>

                  <p>Of faith a chiefe internall cauſe of regeneration, or the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and ſtep thereunto; and of Chriſt againe, as he is the chiefe matter of regeneration, as before we heard him to be one of the principall efficient cauſes likewiſe thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto we haue heard of the dignity of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by the efficient cauſes of their adoption, both principall and inſtrumentall. And all theſe cauſes touching their owne being haue beene externall.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18428:48"/> For although the ſpirit of God be within in vs, when it doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt and regenerat vs, and ſo may be called internal, in reſpect of the operation thereof in vs, yet it may be accounted exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in in reſpect of the being that it hath of it ſelfe, and by it ſelfe, without vs.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be handled for the further amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſaid dignity is faith: becauſe it may be conſidered in this argument, either as a meer internall efficient cauſe of our ſaid adoption and regeneration: or as the firſt ſtep and degree thereunto.</p>
               <p>It may be conſidered firſt as a meere inward thing: becauſe all the being of it is altogether within vs, not at all without vs. It may be conſidered as an efficient cauſe of our adoption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is that whereby we lay hold of Chriſt, by whom and in whom alone, we do both at the firſt receiue the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and be regenerated the children of God: and alſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward do feede ſo vpon him, that wee grow vp to a perfect ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of him. Therefore theſe phraſes, <hi>to come to him, to eat his fleſh, and to drink his bloud are often vſed</hi> (eſpecially <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe our communion with him by faith, and to ſignifie our beleeuing in him. So alſo it is ſaid that <hi>Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts by faith, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17, and that <hi>we ſtand by faith, viz.</hi> in Chriſt <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. So alſo faith is not only the inward inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our communion with Chriſt, but alſo the next foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all other vertues (afterward to be ſpoken of) wherein likewiſe conſiſteth our regeneration and new birth. For by faith our harts are purified, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. and <hi>faith worketh by loue, Galat.</hi> 5. 6. and <hi>this loue is the fulfilling of the Law.

               <p>As alſo, not beleeuing God, and beleeuing the diuell, were the firſt degrees of mans fall, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3. 3. and 6: ſo to caſt away al giuing credit to the diuell, and to beleeue in God, is the firſt degree of our regeneration and new birth, whereby, wee that were fallen are rayſed vp againe.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:18428:49"/>
               <p>This faith is the beleeuing of all things paſt, of all things preſent, of all things to come, conteyned in holy Scripture for vs to beleeue: neyther only the beleeuing of them hiſtorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be true, but alſo the particular application of them to our ſelues.</p>
               <p>The very wicked themſelues, doe beleeue the truth of the Scriptures hiſtorically: yea, many of the reprobat, yea, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diuels <hi>themſelues do ſo beleeue and tremble: Iames 2. 19. Mar.</hi> 1. 24. But the wicked (though elected) before their calling, do not beleeue by particular application; becauſe then their harts ſhould be purified from their wickednes (as before we heard) they hauing apprehended Chriſt <hi>that gaue himſelfe for vs, not only to redeeme vs from all iniquity, but alſo to purge vs &amp;c. Tit.</hi> 2. 14. and that <hi>he might ſanctifie and clenſe vs, &amp;c. Epheſ.</hi> 5. 26. The wicked alſo (though elected) <hi>are in the power of Satan</hi> (as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward we ſhall heare) and to be accounted of the world. But <hi>by faith we ouercome the world:</hi> 1. Ioh. 5. 4. <hi>and the Diuell himſelfe: Epheſ. 6. 16. 1. Pet.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
               <p>The reprobat neither haue faith, neither can haue it: as for the reaſons before vſed touching the wicked generally; ſo alſo becauſe the decree of God touching their reprobation is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well vnreapealeable and vnchangeable as the decree of God touching election: and thoſe reaſons which make alſo for the certainty and perpetuity of the elect, make alſo (for the moſt part) as ſtrongly for the immutability of Gods decree touching reprobation.</p>
               <p>That which hath beene ſayd of the wicked that are elected (viz. before their calling) and of the reprobat to bee without faith, may much more be ſayd of the diuels.</p>
               <p>But for as much, as neither reprobat men, nor the Diuels can beleeue, becauſe Gods decree concerning their reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is vnchangeable, therfore here may a queſtion be moued, whether infidelity and vnbeleefe bee a ſinne or no. For ſith they cannot be ſaued, what ſinne is it in them not to beleeue in him, by whom ſaluation is purchaſed? Nay rather, it may ſeem to be ſinne, to beleeue that that is vntrue.</p>
               <p>I anſwer to the latter firſt, that concerning the diuels, not to beleeue in Chriſt, with application to themſelues, is no ſinne in <note place="margin">Note.</note>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:18428:49"/> them: becauſe, as Chriſt came not to ſaue any of them, neither tooke their nature vpon him, ſo there is no commandement for them to beleeue in him as their Sauiour. Notwithſtanding, God hauing giuen his ſonne for the redemption of all elect men, therefore the diuels not beleeuing this or perſwading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the elect not to it, do therein greatly ſinne, and ſo they ſhall certainly aggrauat their condemnation. This then is breefely the ſolution of this queſtion touching the Diuels, that they ſinne not in not beleeuing in Chriſt for themſelues, but that they ſinne greatly in not beleeuing that Chriſt came to ſaue elect men, and in perſwading any of them not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it.</p>
               <p>Touching reprobate men, though Chriſt came not to ſaue them, neither did ſo much as pray for them. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17, 9. yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gods decree in this behalfe is not particularly knowen vnto them, but God generally propoundeth his promiſes, not particulary telling any by his externall word, whoſe names are written in the booke of life, whoſe are not; but only reuealingthis by the worke of his ſpirit in calling them that are choſen, therefore the ſcripture pronounceth generally of <hi>all men that doe not beleeue, that they are condemned already: Iohn</hi> 3. 18. Who then are they that doe or ſhall beleeue? Only the elect. For therefore it is not onely ſaid that <hi>All men haue not faith. 2.

                  <hi>for euer. &amp;c. Pſalm.</hi> 125. 1.</p>
               <p>All the elect that haue faith, haue not the like meaſure of faith, becauſe God that giueth it, giueth it as pleaſeth him. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 9. and 4. 7. and becauſe all haue not the like meanes neither the like time &amp;c, but where it is left, euen as a grayne of muſtard ſeede (viz. not onely for quantity but alſo for qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18428:50"/> quickneſſe, life and efficacy) there it is moſt holy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious: becauſe to ſuch as haue ſuch faith, nothing (making to Gods glory and their ſaluation,) is impoſſible, yea, all ſuch things are poſſible. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 20. and 21. 21. and <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 23.</p>
               <p>If any obiect the former places, to be vnderſtood of that kind of faith, whereby men wrought miracles, and which was but for a time: I anſwer, that although our Sauiour doe indeed deliuer thoſe ſpeeches by occaſion of ſome miracles, which he had then wrought: yet they are alſo more generally to be vnderſtood euen of a iuſtifying and ſauing faith, as touching the obiect thereof, I meane, as touching matters that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to ſaluation: Otherwiſe that faith whereby a man is to ſaue his owne ſoule, ſhould be inferior to that, and of leſſe force then that, whereby he is to ſaue, (or in thoſe daies was to ſaue) other, by ſuch working of miracles: were not this abſurd in diuinity?</p>
               <p>Thus much ſhall ſuffice to haue ſpoken of faith in this place: either as a ſpeciall and internall cauſe of our regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and new birth to be the children of God, by incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs in to the onely, naturall, and firſt begotten ſonne of God: or at leaſt as the firſt ſtep and degree to our ſaid regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. More perhaps vpon other occaſion, ſhall be ſpoken of this faith afterward. In the meane time, the more excellent that we haue heard it to be, and the more proper to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, the more excellent alſo we muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſtate of the children of God to bee in reſpect thereof.</p>
               <p>The next point to be conſidered is the matter it ſelfe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in chiefly the regeneration of the children of God doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. This is firſt of all, their communion with Chriſt. For Chriſt alone being the onely, naturall and proper ſonne of God (as hath been ſaid) no other can be the children of God (as now we ſpeake) but only by communion with him, and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into him, whereby they may be (ſpiritually) <hi>fleſh of his fleſh, bone of his bone,</hi> and members of that body, whereof him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone is the head. So many as haue this communion with Chriſt, ſo many may truly bee called the beloued children of God. Therefore they that are ſo regenerated are ſaid to be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18428:50"/> againe in Christ Ieſus, 1. Cor. 4. 15. to bee new creatures in Chriſt, 2. Cor. 5. 17. Galat. 6. 5. and to be created in Chriſt Ieſus, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 10. and 4. 24. So farforth therefore as we are in Chriſt, we are the children of God. And ſo many as are not thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into Chriſt, are not in truth, neither ought to be called the children of God. Such perhaps may be ſo accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by other, yea, peraduenture, they may ſo account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. But as thoſe that are begotten in adultery by an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, may be reputed the children of the lawfull husband to the adultereſſe, and yet are indeed baſtards, and for the moſt part may be diſcerned ſo to be by their baſtardly conditions; ſo is it with them that liuing in the Church of God doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe them ſelues to be the children of God, and be ſo reputed by other, and yet haue no communion with Chriſt. Though they be reputed to be the children of God, yet they are no better then baſtards, and baſtards they bewray themſelues to be, by their baſtardly minds and conuerſation.</p>
               <p>Although therefore in one reſpect we reckoned Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore amongſt the efficient cauſes of our regeneration, and that therfore in reſpect of his excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy our regeneration alſo is to be accounted the more excellent: yet in another reſpect, he may alſo be accounted the materiall cauſe of our regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, euen as naturall parents are both the efficient cauſes of our naturall birth, and doe likewiſe communicate the matter of their bodies vnto ours. And ſo the more excellent that before we heard Chriſt to be, the more we may againe conclude the dignity of Gods children to be by his being the chiefe mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall cauſe (as well as the efficient cauſe) of their regeneration. For as that that is made of ſiluer, or gold, or any other ſuch like pretious matter, is it ſelfe more pretious then other things made of braſſe, tinne, lead, yron, Copper, or any other ſuch vile and baſe matter (the quantity of things being alike: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a great veſſell of copper may be better then a very ſmall cup of ſiluer) ſo the more excellent that Chriſt himſelfe is, who is the chiefe matter of Gods children, and of whom they be called Chriſtians (as that that is made of gold is called gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) and the children of God, the more excellent needs muſt be their ſtate and condition,</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>VT leauing that point, (till afterward) let vs in the next place looke into the excellent gifts and graces, which by the former incorporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Chriſt, the children of God doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and in reſpect whereof we are ſaid to be partaker of the diuine nature, and the which likewiſe may be eſteemed as parts (as it were) of that matter whereof they do conſiſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe things let vs conſider by oppoſition of that vnto them, that men are ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> as naturally deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending from <hi>Adam,</hi> and being (as it were) boughs and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of him.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Adam</hi> and by <hi>Adam,</hi> ſince his fall all men (Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe onely excepted) haue vtterly loſt that excellent and glorious image, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> at the firſt were both created: <hi>Geneſ</hi> 1. 26. 27. This loſſe of that excellent and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious image is deſcribed by this phraſe <hi>of dying the death: Geneſ.</hi> 2. 17. This death was not a naturall death, but it was a ſpirituall death: It was not the ſeparation of the ſoule and the body, but it was the ſeparation of God and man, as touching that gratious familiarity which before had beene betwixt them. As the ſoule is the life of the body, ſo is God the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life of the whole man. For man is not ſaid to be aliue vnto God any longer, then he is in grace and fauour with God: ſo that to die the death in that place, was to be vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the inherent grace and fauour of God which before they were created in.</p>
               <p>From that time therefore, that our firſt parents had eaten of the forbidden fruit, and thereby had defaced the image of God in them, they were drowned ouer head and eares in all ſinne; and ſo now alſo in the ſtate of condemnation: and were no more able (of themſelues) to haue gotten out of the ſame,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18428:51"/> then a man drowned and dead in the bottom of a great riuer, or pond, is able of himſelfe to get out. And this is that <hi>dying the death</hi> before ſpoken of, euen a ſpirituall death, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times worſe then any naturall death: I meane, then any ſeparation of the ſoule and body, though the ſame be by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo violent meanes. For it is the beginning and firſt ſtep vnto that euerlaſting death of body and ſoule, whereof after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward we ſhall ſpeake more at large: and from the which, neither wee could haue freed our ſelues, neither could any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, or all creatures, if God himſelfe had not ſent his owne ſonne, as before hath been ſhewed. And that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life which is contrary to the ſaid death, and which is alſo the firſt effect of Chriſt in vs after that once wee are ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and incorporated into him, is the next point of the matter of our regeneration, and being the children of God.</p>
               <p>That we may the better ſee what this life of God is in vs, let vs firſt more largely conſider what the former death is, and how all men are by nature wholly poſſeſſed thereof. That therefore which the Apoſtle ſaith of the Epheſians, is to be vnderſtood of all men by nature: viz. that <hi>they are dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes. Epheſ. 2. 1. without God and without Chriſt in the world</hi> (verſe 12.) as not beleeuing in God or Chriſt, and therefore being condemned already, as before we heard our Sauiour to ſay: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 18. and the rather were they ſo indeed dead in their ſinnes, becauſe they were the children of him <hi>that had the power of death, that is, of the diuell. Heb.</hi> 2. 14. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 44. For Sathan hauing once put out the light and the life of God in <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby he was the child of God, like vnto God, did make him a ſonne to himſelfe; ſo that as before hee did beare the image of God, ſo for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer afterward hee and all his (Chriſt onely excepted) did beare the image of the diuell: in which reſpect it is ſaide ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, <hi>that hee that committeth ſinne is of the diuell: 1. Iohn</hi> 3. 8.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, that our naturall ſtate is not as the Papiſts plead it to be, by allegorizing vpon him that our Sauiour ſaith did <hi>fall into the hands of theeues, and was by them wounded and left halfe dead. Luk</hi> 10. 30. but farre worſe: not halfe miſerable,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18428:52"/> but altogether miſerable: not wounded, and yet aliue, though halfe dead, but ſo wounded, that we are altogether dead.</p>
               <p>We haue a vegetatiue and an animall life, as all liuing and brutiſh creatures haue: we haue a reaſonable life, to talke, and reaſon and diſcourſe, and determine and conclude of naturall things, and of things pertaining to this life, whereby we differ from beaſts: but as touching the ſpirituall life whereby to thinke of any thing, to affect any thing, to approue of any thing, to ſpeake of any thing, or to doe any thing towards e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſaluation of body and ſoule; and as touching that life of God, that is, that life that is acceptable to God, (as <hi>the worke of God: Ioh. 6. 29. and the workes of the Lord: 1. Cor,</hi> 15. 5. 8. are ſuch as are acceptable to God) as touching this life (I ſay) which is the firſt degree and the very beginning of eternal life, to be afterward enioyed with God and his holy Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, all the whole poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> (Chriſt only ſtill excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) is altogether void of. For as the root and ſtocke of a tree, being altogether dead without any ſparke of naturall life ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it is not poſſible that any of the boughs or branches can be aliue; and as it is not poſſible for thoſe men and women that are altogether naturally dead (their ſoules and bodies being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated one from another) to bring forth liuing children: ſo it is not poſſible, that our firſt parents beeing altogether dead vnto God, and without the life of God before ſpoken of, we or any other of their poſterity ſhould be aliue vnto God.</p>
               <p>They may ſeeme to haue this ſpirituall life, and this life of God, becauſe after a naturall manner they can conceiue, and doe conceiue ſome things thereof; yea (ſometimes) the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt myſteries thereof, either after a meere carnall ſort; or by the ſpeciall wiſedom of God reuealing the ſame vnto them for the furthering of the ſaluation of other, and for the making of themſelues the more inexcuſable, and ſo for the increaſing of their own condemnation: but in truth and deed they are altogether deſtitute of it. In this caſe it is with them, as it is with many a woman, that hauing a Tympany, &amp; by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of water, or of ſome other matter of the ſaid Tympany or other ſuch like diſeaſe, feeling ſome little ſtirring in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, like the mouing of a yong infant, doth therefore thinke
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18428:52"/> her ſelfe with child: and yet in the end ſhe is deceiued, being not with child with any other thing then of a diſeaſe vnto death: ſo (I ſay) many naturall and wicked men hauing ſome ſimilitude, and like actions of the life of God in them; and feeling as it were ſome little motions of ſuch life, (as it were little flaſhes, ſuddenly wrought, and ſuddenly vaniſhing, like lightning) do therfore thinke themſelues with child of Chriſt, and to haue conceiued him in the womb of their hearts, but in the end they are deceiued, and find themſelues only with child of a ſpirituall ſickneſſe vnto death; that is, of hypocriſie and of a bare reſemblance of the life of God in them, and not to haue that life it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>This is not only euident by the former teſtimony of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, but alſo by another afterward in the ſame Epiſtle, where he deſcribeth our naturall ſtate and condition to be, that we <hi>had our vnderſtanding darkned, and were ſtrangers from the life of God through the ignorance that was in vs becauſe of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our hearts. Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18. Thus (I ſay) in that place the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle deſcribeth the ſtate of all men naturally.</p>
               <p>The ſame namely that we are all void of that life of God, is manifeſt by other reaſons.</p>
               <p>To omit that before inſinuated, viz. that as the body is dead without the communion of the ſoule, ſo man cannot be aliue vnto God that hath loſt his communion with God: and that indeed <hi>naturally men are without God in the world,</hi> and that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are without Chriſt: Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. by whom alone there is communion betwixt God and man, and in whom alone <hi>is that life ſo that he that hath the ſonne hath life: and he that hath not the ſonne hath not that life: 1. Ioh.</hi> 5. 11. 12. although after a common manner effectiuely <hi>we all liue, moue, and haue our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God: Acts</hi> 17. 18. To omit (I ſay) this reaſon, the ſame is further manifeſt, becauſe all meer naturall men, are alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the immortall ſeed of God in them, whereby they ſhould be borne againe the children of God. This immortall ſeed is the ſpirit of God, as before we haue heard. Meer naturall men therfore being without this ſeed, how can they haue the life of God in them?</p>
               <p>Againe, if naturally we haue this life of God in vs, it muſt be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18428:53"/> in our ſoules, or in our bodies. It is neither in our ſoules, nor in our bodies: therefore not at all.</p>
               <p>Touching our ſoules, what life of God can be in them, when as we cannot ſo much as <hi>thinke a good thought of our ſelues? 2. Cor.</hi> 3. 5. but al <hi>the imaginations of our heart are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally euill: Geneſ.</hi> 6. 5. and when as we cannot ſo much as will any thing that is good of our ſelues; <hi>but it is God that worketh the will as well as the worke? Philip.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
               <p>Where there is any life, there will be ſome hunger and thirſt after meat and drinke for preſeruing of life, or at leaſt ſome deſire of other meanes of life. But (alaſſe) ſo farre are we from all hunger and thirſt after either bread or water of life, that we do vtterly refuſe them and reiect them offered vnto vs. Yea, (that which is more) <hi>we lay foorth our ſiluer for that which is not bread: and we labour and take great paines for that which will not ſatisfie vs: Iſai.</hi> 55. 2. Thoſe things therfore being as it were the very breath of the life of God, if we haue them not, how can we haue that life of God it ſelfe? For what life can there be without breath?</p>
               <p>If our ſoules be thus dead, what life of God can be in our bodies? As our Sauiour ſaith: <hi>If the light that is in vs be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, how great is that darkneſſe? Matth.</hi> 6. 23. ſo may I ſay, <hi>If the life that is in vs be deadneſſe, how great is that deadneſſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our eares cannot attend to the word of God, (therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo not to any other goodneſſe) except <hi>God open our hearts, Acts</hi> 16. 14. we cannot ſo much as turne our eyes from any vanity except the Lord do turn them, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 36. we cannot <hi>open our lips that our mouth may ſhew forth the praiſe of God,</hi> except God do open them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 15. neither can we ſo much as ſay that <hi>Ieſus is the Lord, but by the holy ghoſt: 1. Cor.</hi> 12. 5.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, this our ſpirituall death doth appeare by our bearing all ſpirituall burthens (though neuer ſo heauy) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſenſe and feeling of them. What is heauier then ſand? yet all the ſand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n the whole world, yea the whole earth with all the minerals of ſiluer, gold, lead, yron, tynne, and pewter, with all the quarries of ſtones, with all the buildings and all other creatures thereupon, is not ſo heauy as ſinne. Did not the imputation only of other mens ſinnes vnto Chriſt lie ſo
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18428:53"/> heauy vpon him, that he (though he were God and man) was in ſuch an agony that <hi>his ſweat was like drops of bloud:</hi> yet doe all men remaining in their naturall ſtate, and not being born againe, go vnder their own inherent ſinnes, originall and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, how long ſo euer they haue continued in them, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they haue multiplied and aggrauated them; they goe vnder them (I ſay) as lightly, without any ſenſe or feeling of the waight and burden of them, as though indeed they had none at all. Is not this an euident argument of extreme dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? For what do they that are once dead feele, whatſoeuer is laid vpon them? To ſpeake all in a word, and not to ſtand any longer vpon particulars, the Apoſtle from other ſcriptures doth not only ſay that we are dead vnto all goodneſſe, but alſo that in euery part &amp; member of our whole man, we are aliue vnto all euill. For thus he deſcribeth the naturall ſtate of all men: <hi>There is none righteous, no not one. There is none that doth vnderſtand: there is none that ſeeketh God. They haue all gone out of the way: they haue been made altogether vnprofitable: there is none that doth good, no not one: their throat is an open ſepulchre they haue vſed their tongues to deceit: the poiſon of Aſpes is vnder their lips. Their mouth is full of curſing and bitterneſſe. Their feet are ſwift to ſhed bloud, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 3. 10. By theſe things we ſee, that though naturall men do liue, yet as it is ſaid of <hi>the widdow that liueth in pleaſures, that ſhe is dead, whiles ſhe liueth, 1. Tim.</hi> 5. 6. ſo it may be ſaid of all naturall men, <hi>liuing in the pleaſures of ſinne, that they are dead whiles they ſo liue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This our liuing vnto ſinne and in ſinne, (being dead to all goodneſſe) may in ſome ſort be called a ſpirituall life: not as ſpirituall is oppoſed to carnall, but in two other reſpects: firſt, becauſe it is from that vncleane ſpirit, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 23. &amp; 7. 25. 26 who is not only the <hi>father of lies, Ioh.</hi> 8. 44. but alſo of all other euill: ſecondly, becauſe all the workes of a ſinfull life are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the ſame vncleane ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith not only, <hi>that we are</hi> (naturally) <hi>dead in treſpaſſes, but alſo that wee walked in them after the Prince that ruleth in the aire,</hi> that is, according to his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and preſcription: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2 Our Sauiour alſo ſaith that ſuch ſinnes are <hi>the workes and luſts of the diuell: Ioh.</hi> 8. 41. 44.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18428:54"/> And as Idolaters are ſaid <hi>to ſacrifice to diuels, 1. Cor.</hi> 10. 20. ſo all wicked men may be ſaid to do all that they doe vnto diuels. Thus we ſee in part the miſerable and wofull ſtate of all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men. For what is more fearefull then death? when <hi>Saul</hi> did but heare (only by the father of lyes in the likeneſſe of <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el;</hi> and therefore the rather ſpeaking the truth, that he might the more confirme <hi>Saul</hi> in his error touching the raiſing of <hi>Samuel)</hi> when (I ſay) <hi>Saul</hi> did but heare, that <hi>the next day hee ſhould be deliuered into the hands of the Philiſtines and bee ſlaine,</hi> how did it affect him? How did it ſtrike him with feare? verily ſo, that he <hi>fell ſtraightway all along vpon the earth, and there was no ſtrength in him:</hi> yea ſo that neither the woman, (the witch that had raiſed vp the diuell in the likeneſſe of <hi>Samuel)</hi> nor any of his own ſeruants with him could ſcarce faſten any comfort vpon him: 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 20. &amp;c. If the very tidings of this naturall death be ſo fearefull, how much more fearefull is that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all death before ſpoken of?</p>
               <p>Hauing thus in part ſhewed our naturall miſery by theſe things ſpoken of our ſpirituall deadneſſe, let vs now ſee the change that is made in vs by our incorporation into Chriſt, in our adoption, and regeneration. Let vs therefore vnderſtand that in our ſaid regeneration and new birth by Ieſus Chriſt, we are deliuered from that our foreſaid miſerable ſtate. As before we did beare the <hi>image of the earthly man. ſo now we beare the image of him, that is from heauen heauenly: that is, of the Lord Chriſt.</hi> As Chriſt in his diuine eſſence, <hi>is the brightneſſe of the glory of the father, and the ingraued forme of his perſon, Heb.</hi> 1. 3. ſo we in quality being <hi>made partaker of the diuine nature; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt made new creatures, and being alſo the workmanſhip of God in Chriſt Ieſus, created vnto good workes, that wee ſhould walke in them,</hi> (as hath been before ſhewed by ſeuerall ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) we are by this meanes made like to Chriſt Ieſus, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently alſo to God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>As therefore the Apoſtle ſaith that naturally we are dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, ſo hee ſaith in the ſame place, that <hi>God which is rich in mercy, through his great loue wherewith he loued vs euen when we were ſo dead by ſinnes</hi> (or <hi>in ſinnes) hath quickned vs,</hi> (or <hi>made vs aliue) in Chriſt, Ephe.</hi> 2. 4. 5.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18428:54"/> that the word (quickned) is only expreſſed originally in that <note place="margin">Note.</note> fift verſe, and that although it be interpoſed by tranſlators in the firſt verſe, for perſpicuities ſake (as they thought) yet it is rather there to be omitted: and that that firſt verſe is rather to be read with the laſt verſe of the firſt chapter of <hi>Chriſts filling all things in all things</hi> (or <hi>with all things)</hi> that is, with all gifts fit for euery one: ſo that the verb <hi>filled,</hi> is rather to be vnderſtood in the firſt verſe, then the verb <hi>quickned:</hi> and that firſt verſe to be vnderſtood as an amplification of the generall handled in the end of the former Chapter, by the particular inſtance of the Epheſians, as if he ſhould haue ſaid: As Chriſt hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally filled all things <hi>giuen vnto him by the father,</hi> with all gifts fit for them, ſo particularly he hath filled you that were by nature <hi>dead in your treſpaſſes and ſinnes:</hi> and ſo he deſcribeth by that occaſion their naturall ſtate: verſ. 1. 2. 3. and then he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth our new and ſpirituall ſtate in the 4. and 5. verſes by Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But to leaue this place, and to returne to the former point of Chriſts freeing vs from ſpirituall death, and quickning vs and making vs aliue againe, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith further, that <hi>Chriſt hath aboliſhed death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpell: 2. Tim.</hi> 1. 10. which Goſpell is therefore called the <hi>word of life. Ioh. 6. 68. Philip.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour likewiſe ſaith: <hi>Verely verely I ſay vnto you, the houre ſhall come, and now is, when the dead ſhall heare the voice of the ſonne of God, and they that heare it ſhall liue. For as the father hath life in himſelfe, ſo likewiſe hath he giuen to the ſonne to haue life in himſelfe. Ioh.</hi> 5. 25. 26. viz. <hi>to beſtow life vpon all that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath giuen vnto him. Ioh.</hi> 10. 28. 29. <hi>Euery where</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> againe) <hi>we beare about in our bodies, the dying of our Lord Ieſus</hi> (that is, euery where we doe in a manner <hi>die daily</hi> for Ieſus his ſake. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 38.) But wherefore? <hi>That the life of Ieſus might alſo be made manifeſt in our bodies. 2. Cor.</hi> 4. 10. But what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth he, by making manifeſt <hi>the life of Ieſus in our bodies?</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this, that by their conſtant, patient, and cheerfull ſufferings of ſo many things (as it were ſo many deaths for Chriſts ſake) all men might the better ſee, how Chriſt had quickned them, and what great meaſure of ſpirituall life he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18428:55"/> had wrought in them? So the Apoſtle telleth the Romanes, that <hi>they were dead to ſinne, but aliue to God, in Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. Rom.</hi> 6. 11. Of himſelfe he ſaith, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, but I liue: yet not I any more, but Christ liueth in me: and in that that now I liue in the fleſh,</hi> (that is, in this fraile and mortall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as the word <hi>fleſh</hi> is taken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7.) <hi>I liue by faith in the ſonne of God, &amp;c? Gal.</hi> 2. 20. Many other the like places to the ſame purpoſe, I doe willingly for beare, that I may not be too tedious. By theſe we doe ſufficiently ſee, that being borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new vnto God in Chriſt, we are not ſtill-borne (as men vſe to ſpeake of children dead before birth) but that we haue a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life in him and by him. Yet let vs vnderſtand this by the way, that our ſpirituall life by <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> is not altogether the <note place="margin">Note.</note> ſame that our former ſpirituall death was by <hi>Adam,</hi> and by our ſinnes traduced from <hi>Adam.</hi> For, as we haue heard, we were perfectly dead, (not halfe dead) in our ſinnes by <hi>Adam:</hi> euen ſo dead that wee were altogether void of the life of God, and without any remnants of the former image of God in vs. But our life renewed by Ieſus Chriſt, is not in this world perfect, and without ſome remnant of the old <hi>Adam</hi> in vs. Therefore we are willed euery day, <hi>to put off the old man: Epheſ.</hi> 4. 2. and that <hi>we caſt away all filthineſſe, and ſuperfluity of malitiouſneſſe. I am. 1. 21. 1. Pet.</hi> 2. 1. as alſo that <hi>we put on Chriſt: Rom. 13. 14. and the new man, which after God</hi> (or <hi>according to God) is created vnto righteouſneſſe in true holineſſe: Epheſ. 4. 24. &amp;c.</hi> No man therfore hath ſo put off or caſt off the old man, but that there be ſtill ſome ragges and patches remaining of him. No man hath ſo put on the new man, but that he may put him on ſomewhat more. As no man putteth on all his apparell at once, but firſt one thing, then another, ſo is it with putting on of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> All our life here is but as it were the morning of the life to come, to dreſſe vs for our mariage vnto Chriſt: as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that he had <hi>prepared the Corinthians</hi> (that is, he had laboured to dreſſe them) <hi>for one husband, and to preſent them a pure virgin vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt: 2. Cor.</hi> 11. 2. Notwithſtanding that which remaineth of the old man, is but (as I ſaid) peeces and patches. For there is ſuch a rent made in him by Chriſt, that all remaining is but as ragges, torne one from another, and not ſowen together,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18428:55"/> and therefore ſuch, as in the end will be the more eaſily ſhaken off. Though all our former ſinnes doe remaine in ſubſtance in vs, yet Chriſt hath ſo taken away their life from them, that they are but as wounds in a dead body. As Chriſt in his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <note place="margin">Note.</note> had ſome ſcarres remaining in his body (of the wounds which he had receiued before his death) and that the better to aſſure weake and vnbeleeuing <hi>Thomas,</hi> and all other therein like to <hi>Thomas,</hi> that he was the ſame that had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put to death: ſo in our regeneration to be the children of God, whereby <hi>we are buried with Chriſt vnto his death: Rom. 6. 4. Coloſ.</hi> 2. 12. and raiſed vp likewiſe with him by his reſurrection to newneſſe of life, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 1. there remaine ſome ſcarres of our old man and of thoſe things whereby and wherein before we were dead, to put vs the better in mind, what we were by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before Chriſt quickned vs and reſtored vs to life. The ſaid ſinnes alſo ſo remaining touching their bodies (as it were) are ſo without life by Chriſts quickning of vs, that they are but as dead carcaſes, to ſhew what a mighty victory Chriſt hath gotten in vs. Furthermore the moſt that can be ſaid of the ſinnes remaining in the regenerated, is this, that being woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to death, they are mortified, as quickſiluer is mortified in oyntments. For as the quickſiluer in the bodily ſubſtance of it remaineth, but is killed touching the life and all hurtfull power that before it had, and ſo is made ſoueraigne to ſome healthfull vſes by mixture of other things with it (which alſo may be ſaid of the conuerting of any other things of a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous nature in themſelues, to be antidots and preſeruatiues againſt poiſon by art, and mixture of other things with them:) ſo the ſinnes of the regenerate remaining touching their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes, are ſpoiled of their life, and of all hurtfull power before in them: and being mixt (as it were) with the grace of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in vs, and communicated vnto vs by Chriſt, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects (partly before, and partly afterward to be more ſpoken of) are turned to our good. Finally touching the life of our ſinnes remaining in vs, after regeneration, it is no other then the life that remaineth in the body of a ſerpent, the head whereof is cruſhed in pieces. For though the body of ſuch a ſerpent, may perhaps moue a little; yet it is but for a time,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18428:56"/> and it can doe no harme at all.</p>
               <p>This ſpirituall life thus hitherto ſpoken of, is to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our ſpirituall breathing, and by other ſpirituall effects thereof. As the naturall life is to be diſcerned by naturall brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and by other naturall effects ſutable thereunto: ſo is our ſpirituall life by ſpirituall breathing, and by other ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall effects. By ſpirituall breathing, I meane ſpirituall thoughts and meditations of the mind and the like motions and affections of the heart. If therefore, whereas naturally our minds are ſet altogether vpon earthly things, there ſhall be ſuch a change wrought in vs, that they ſhall be as much ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>the things that are aboue where Chriſt Ieſus ſitteth at the right hand of God, Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 1. as before they were ſet vpon the things <hi>here below:</hi> and if we ſhall couet and deſire, and euery way affect heauenly things, as much as euer we haue done earthly, then ſhall we haue good teſtimony to our ſelues, that we are borne from aboue and are the children of him that is the father of lights and of euery good and perfect gift: whereas before alſo we loathed the Manna that came down from heauen, as much as the people of Iſrael euen loathed that Manna that God gaue them in the wilderneſſe for feeding of their bodies, we ſhall on the contrary hunger as much after the bread of God that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth to eternall life, and thirſt after the water of life, which whoſoeuer drinketh of he ſhall neuer thirſt againe; and if we ſhall as new borne babes <hi>deſire the ſincere milke of the word that we may grow thereby, 1. Pet.</hi> 2. 2. this ſhall be a further aſſurance to our own hearts that we our ſelues are borne of God.</p>
               <p>The like is to be ſaid of other ſpirituall actions, ſo alſo of our ſpirituall growth and increaſe. For as the naturall child new borne doth daily wax and increaſe in ſtature and in ſtrength till it be able to goe and to doe other things anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the growth thereof, as digeſting of ſtronger meats, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of burdens, ſpeaking like a man, &amp;c: ſo is it with all that are new borne, not of mortall but <hi>of immortall ſeed by the word of God.</hi> They will be able to digeſt high points of doctrine, and not ſay of ſome things, as ſome ſaid of Chriſts doctrine touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>his fleſh to bee meat in deed, and his bloud to be drinke indeed, This is an hard ſaying; who can heare it?</hi> and ſo take occaſion to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18428:56"/> leaue Chriſt, and <hi>to walke no more with him: Ioh.</hi> 6. 60. and 66. They will be able to walke ſtrongly vp and downe, not ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at euery ſtraw.</p>
               <p>They will bee able to beare Gods chaſtiſements without murmuring, &amp; wrongs at the hands of men without ſeeking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, &amp;c. They will be able to do the works of God, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to all Chriſtians, and alſo which are more ſutable to their ſpeciall callings. Theſe things (I ſay) and ſuch like, will all borne againe, grow to doe: and by theſe things they ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne their ſpirituall birth, and the life of God to be in them. Notwithſtanding theſe things are not alike in all that are new borne, no not in all of the ſame ſpirituall age. For as it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt naturall men touching naturall ſtrength, ſome are of a low ſtature, ſome of a taller, ſome are ſtrong men, ſome are weaklings, yea, ſometimes the yonger are taller and ſtronger then their elders by many yeeres: ſo is it amongſt ſpirituall men touching this ſpirituall life, and this ſpirituall birth wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of now we ſpeake. But theſe things ſhall be more manifeſt, by other things after to be ſpoken.</p>
               <p>This life of God is the more excellent, becauſe it is euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting: Being once begun, it ſhall neuer haue end: being once giuen, it ſhall neuer be taken away. Our naturall life ſhall haue an end: (I meane the life of the body and ſoule together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and continued by naturall meanes) and no man knoweth how ſoone. But the life of God ſhall continue, as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe abideth for euer; and as the ſeed whereby men are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to this life, is not mortall but immortall. But of this alſo more afterward.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, by that which hath been ſaid, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that this benefit of our ſpirituall life, is a matter well worthy of all good account and reckoning. This preſent life, which our bodies doe liue in this world, by their communion with the ſoule, is greatly to be eſteemed: yea, more then all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things appertaining thereunto. Satan himſelfe could ſay vnto God, <hi>Skin for skinne, and all that euer a man hath will he giue for his life. Iob</hi> 2. 4. Amongſt the benefits for which wiſedome is commended <hi>about ſiluer and gold, and pearles, and all things that can be deſired, length of daies</hi> is not only one, but alſo the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18428:57"/> firſt, and placed <hi>in the right hand of wiſedome,</hi> whereas <hi>riches and glory</hi> are in the ſecond place, and ſaid to be <hi>in the left hand. Pro.</hi> 3. 16. Our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Is not the life more worth then meat? Mat.</hi> 6. 25. What then is to be compared vnto it? what benefit ſhall a man haue by any other thing, yea, by all other things, if he haue not meat? The Prophet ſaith, that <hi>none of thoſe that truſt in their goods, and beaſt themſelues in the multitude of their riches, can redeeme his brother</hi> (viz. appointed by God to dye) <hi>or giue a ranſome for him</hi> (that is, no man can by any mony prolong the daies of his friend, or buy out his death) <hi>ſo precious is the redemption of their ſoules, &amp;c. that he may liue for euer. Pſal.</hi> 49. 6. 7. 8. 9. Is this naturall life ſo precious, which yet (as I ſaid) ſhall haue an end, and no man knoweth, either how ſoon, or in what place, or in what manner? How excellent then is that ſpirituall life, the life of God, and the life that is eternall? The more excellent therefore that this life is, (being a part of that matter wherein conſiſteth our new birth, next to Chriſt himſelfe, and comming by Chriſt,) the more excellent alſo is the new birth it ſelfe of the children of God, and their ſtate and condition thereby. Thus much for the life of God, which all the children of God haue in their regeneration by Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

And theſe things are to bee taken as ſome
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18428:57"/> particular degrees of the life of God generally before ſpoken of, as alſo as parts of the new man, and of the image of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired and reſtored in our regeneration: yea finally as parts alſo of our ſaid regeneration it ſelfe: Of theſe things I will ſpeake as before I haue done generally of the life of God: viz. by oppoſing vnto them the naturall ignorance, fooliſhneſſe, and madneſſe of all naturall men not regenerated, that ſo by this oppoſition of their contraries, the ſaid true knowledge, vnderſtanding and wiſedome, may be made manifeſt to be the more excellent things, and the more to ſet foorth the dignity of our regeneration. Now as theſe things (I meane this our naturall ignorance, fooliſhneſſe, and madneſſe) be contrary to true knowledge, vnderſtanding, and wiſedome, ſo the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may be ſaid of theſe euils, that hath been ſaid of thoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, viz. that as thoſe vertues are degrees and parts of the life of God of the new man, and of the image of God newly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all that are regenerated: ſo theſe euils are alſo to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as degrees and parts of that death; of that old man, and of that image of Satan in all the vnregenerate, before ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally touched.</p>
               <p>Touching both theſe contraries, they are expreſſed firſt by certaine metaphors, the better to ſet forth their nature. Theſe metaphors are, <hi>light</hi> and <hi>darkneſſe; ſight and blindneſſe,</hi> and ſuch other phraſes as are ſutable to the ſaid metaphors. Secondly, they are further taught by their owne proper words, euen the words before mentioned. Touching the foreſaid metaphors the Apoſtle ſaith firſt of the two firſt couple (light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) <hi>The night is paſt and the day is at hand, let vs therefore caſt away the workes of darkneſſe, and let vs put on the armor of light. Rom.</hi> 13. 12. And again: <hi>Ye were once darkneſſe, but are now light, walke as the children of the light. Epheſ. 5. 8. And haue no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the vnfruitfull works of darkneſſe,</hi> verſe 11. And againe, <hi>Who hath deliuered vs from the power of darkneſſe and tranſlated vs into the kingdome of his deare ſonne. Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 13. So he teacheth, that there is no participation of the kingdome of Chriſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept firſt <hi>we be deliuered from the power of darkneſſe:</hi> And againe: <hi>But ye brethren, are not in darkneſſe that that day ſhould come on you as it were a theefe; ye are all the children of the light, and the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18428:58"/> children of the day: wee are not of the night, neither of darkneſſe: 1. The. 5. 4. 5. Peter</hi> ſaith: <hi>Ye are a choſen generation, a royall prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood an holy nation: a peculiar people: that ye ſhould ſhew foorth the vertues of him that hath called you out of darkneſſe into his maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light: 1. Pet. 2. 9. Iohn</hi> ſaith: <hi>The darkneſſe is paſt and the true light now ſhineth. 1. Ioh. 2. 8. Zachariah</hi> the father of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſaith: <hi>that the day ſpring from on-high had viſited them, to giue light to them that ſit in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death. Luk.</hi> 1. 78. 79.</p>
               <p>By darkneſſe in all the places before alleged is meant that extreme ignorance without any knowledge of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the minds of all men naturally are ouerwhelmed before ſuch time as they be regenerated. The ſame is likewiſe ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the word <hi>blindneſſe</hi> in diuers other places. <hi>The Lord gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth light to the blind. Pſa.</hi> 146. 8. that is, the Lord giueth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to them that are ignorant. The Prophet alſo ſetting forth the glory of Chriſts kingdome, ſaith: <hi>Then ſhall the eyes of the blind be lightned: Iſai.</hi> 55. 5. that is, then they ſhall been<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with the true knowledge of God, that before were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of him, and knew no more for their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then a ſtone-blind man doth ſee colours. The ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaking of the office of Chriſt ſaith, that the Lord had called him &amp;c. <hi>that he might open the eyes of the blind, and bring out the priſoners from the priſon, and them that ſit in darkneſſe out of the priſon houſe. Iſai.</hi> 42. 7. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſpeaketh the very like of his Apoſtleſhip, noting the end therof to haue been <hi>to open the eyes of the Gentiles</hi> (here he ſignifieth that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were ſpiritually blind) <hi>that they might turne from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan vnto God. Acts</hi> 26. 18. Our Sauiour ſaith <hi>of euery plant whom the father had not planted, that they were blind leaders of the blind,</hi> and, <hi>if the blinde lead the blind, they ſhall both fall into the ditch. Matth.</hi> 15. 14. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the opening alſo of his eies that had beene borne bodily blind, our Sauiour ſaith: <hi>I am come vnto iudgement into this world that they which ſee not</hi> (that is, which are blind and ignorant of God and of the things pertaining to their euerlaſting peace) <hi>might ſee: and that they which did ſee</hi> (that is, that thought they knew much) <hi>might be made blind:</hi> (that is, might haue that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18428:58"/> from them which they ſeemed to haue: <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 18.) Vpon which words of our Sauiour the Phariſies replying, <hi>Are we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo blind?</hi> our Sauiour anſwereth further, <hi>If yee were blind, yee ſhould not haue ſinne &amp;c. Iohn</hi> 9. 39. 40. 41. that is, if ye were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant indeed, your ſinne ſhould be ſo much the leſſe. I might heape vp many other the like teſtimonies touching the ſaid metaphors of darkneſſe and blindneſſe ſo applied: But theſe alleged ſhall be ſufficient. They are both vſed in the former, and in other places to ſignifie the ſame thing, viz. the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, blindneſſe and extreme ignorance of our minds concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God and our ſaluation, becauſe indeed they are both of like nature. For he that is in darkneſſe can ſee nothing, though he haue neuer ſo good eyes: and he that is blind can likewiſe ſee nothing, though the ſunne, or moon or ſtarres, or candles, or fire be neuer ſo cleere or bright.</p>
               <p>By theſe metaphors doth the holy ghoſt ſo often expreſſe our ignorance, becauſe they doe beſt agree with that which before we heard of our being by nature the children of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, who is called the prince of darkneſſe: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 12. and whoſe kingdome is ſaid to be <hi>the place of vtter darkneſſe. Mat.</hi> 8. 12. and 22. 13. and 25. 30. as alſo becauſe they doe well agree with the maine thing before ſpoken of the ſpirituall death of all naturall and vnregenerated men: for they that are dead are alſo depriued of all ſight: and therefore they be in continuall darkneſſe. In which reſpect death is deſcribed <hi>to bee the land of darkneſſe. Iob</hi> 10. 21. and the Pſalmiſt ſaith: <hi>Wilt thou ſhew a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to the dead, or ſhall the dead riſe and praiſe thee? Shall thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindneſſe be declared in the graue, or thy faithfulneſſe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?</hi> then he addeth, <hi>Shall thy wondrous workes be knowen in the darke, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 88. 10. 11. 12. And finally that ſo we might the better ſee the vncomfortable, wofull, and moſt miſerable eſtate and condition of all men naturally, to make them the more thankfull for their comfortable, ioyfull, and moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed change by grace and regeneration. For is not darkneſſe one of the great iudgements inflicted by the Lord vpon the ſonnes of men for their moſt hainous ſinnes? was it not one of Gods fearefull iudgements in Egypt? <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 22. When our Sauiour was moſt wickedly and vnrighteouſly put to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18428:59"/> death (the greateſt ſinne that euer was before committed) <hi>was there no: darkneſſe in all the land from the ſixt houre to the ninth? Mat.</hi> 27. 45.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of blindneſſe: When the Sodomites came vpon <hi>Lot,</hi> to haue abuſed the Angels entertained by him, did not the ſaid Angels ſmite them with blindneſſe: <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 11. Amongſt the reſt of the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts alſo which the Lord threatneth to the Iſraelites, if they ſhould not obey him, &amp;c, doth he not threaten <hi>to ſmite them with madneſſe and blindneſſe? Deut.</hi> 28. 28.</p>
               <p>Where let it bee obſerued that hee conioineth madneſſe and blindneſſe: let this (I ſay) bee obſerued, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manifeſtation of that which afterward I ſhall ſay touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the madneſſe of all men naturally. When <hi>Elymas</hi> alſo the Sorcerer reſiſted <hi>Paul,</hi> was he not ſtricken with blindneſſe for certaine daies? <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 8. Againe, who knoweth not by his owne experience, how fearefull a thing darkneſſe and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is? when the miſt and darkneſſe before ſignified fel vpon <hi>Elymas,</hi> did not he go about ſeeking one to lead him? doth not any man that is blind or in darkneſſe groap here and there? Is he not euery minute in danger? at leaſt doth he not, and may he not continually feare? Is it not more vncomfortable to walke or ride one mile in the night, then ſix in the day time? If outward darkneſſe, and bodily blindneſſe be ſo vncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, what (alaſſe) is to be ſaid of inward darkneſſe, and of the ſpirituall blindneſſe of the mind? If it be an heauy thing to be depriued of all light of Sunne, Moone, Starres, candle, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fire, how heauy is it to be vtterly deſtitute of the light of the Sunne of righteouſneſſe?</p>
               <p>As darkneſſe and blindneſſe bee moſt vncomfortable, ſo who knoweth not how ſweet and comfortable the contrary light and ſight are? And if the outward light and bodily ſight be ſo ſweet and comfortable, how much more ſweet and comfortable are ſpirituall light, and the ſight of the inward man? Theſe things I might amplifie by many arguments, the more to ſet foorth the dignity of Gods children, that doe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enioy the ſaid ſpirituall light, and whoſe mindes doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and vnderſtand the high things of God, pertaining to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18428:59"/> their ſaluation: but becauſe it followeth to ſpeake of them in the next place, therefore this ſhall be ſufficient to haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here.</p>
               <p>Thus to leaue the former metaphors, I come to the things ſignified by them. Touching therefore the ignorance of God in all naturall and vnregenerate men, we heard before that the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Gentiles as they were ſuch, had ioined theſe together, <hi>hauing their vnderstanding darkned, and being ſtrangers from the life of God, through the ignorance that was in them. Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18. To the ſame purpoſe ſpeaking againe of the ſtate of himſelfe and other before regeneration he ſaith, <hi>We were in times paſt vnwiſe, &amp;c. Tit.</hi> 3. 3. That which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we alleged out of the third to the Romanes, as by other things to deſcribe the naturall ſtate of all men, ſo by this that <hi>none whatſoeuer doth vnderſtand any thing,</hi> ſhall not need here to be repeated. Yea, ſo farre are all men naturally from all true knowledge of God, that they are vtterly vncapeable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>For the naturall man perceiueth not the things of the ſpirit of God. for they are fooliſhneſſe vnto him: neither can hee know them; for they are ſpiritually diſcerned: 1. Cor.</hi> 2. 14. Yea, the more naturall wit and vnderſtanding men haue (which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led naturall wiſedome, or <hi>the wiſedome of the fleſh)</hi> the further off they are from all true knowledge and wiſedome of God. <hi>For the wiſedome of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By the neuter gender here hee meaneth the maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and by things hee vnderſtandeth perſons: as alſo wee haue the like phraſe: <hi>Iohn 6. 37. Colosſians 1. 20. Epheſians</hi> 1. 10.</p>
               <p>This is a point of great moment, and the more worthy a little more to be inſiſted vpon, becauſe many naturall men are men of great humane learning, in the tongues, in the arts, in all philoſophie, in the lawes and ſtatutes of kingdomes: in martiall and ciuill affaires for warre and for peace. And for ſuch learning they are oft times in great reputation,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18428:60"/> in great honor and authority: euen aduanced to bee great ſtates men, to ſtand before the mighty Princes of the world, to giue counſell vnto them, and accounted the only men for policy and gouernment of kingdomes. Such were <hi>Achitophel</hi> and <hi>Ioab;</hi> and ſuch (no doubt) are many in theſe daies in many kingdomes: and ſuch haue been many in all ages: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding are ſo far from all true knowledge of God, that they doe vtterly diſtaſt the ſame, and oppoſe themſelues with tooth and naile, with might and maine thereunto.</p>
               <p>Some alſo (meer naturall men) haue ſuch knowledge in the myſteries of God, that they can teach other, and being called to the miniſtery doe conuert others, themſelues being caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies. For <hi>Iudas</hi> receiued gifts, and a commiſſion to preach as well as other: and it is not to be doubted, but that he did ſome good by the exerciſe of his gifts, and execution of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as well as other. For there is no commandement or commiſſion from God, without a promiſe of a bleſſing: and there is no promiſe of a bleſſing, but that God ſome way or other, and in ſome meaſure or other doth performe the ſame: becauſe <hi>he that hath promiſed is faithfull, Heb.</hi> 10. 23. Therefore our Sauiour ſaith, that in the laſt day many ſhould plead <hi>that they had prophecied euen in his name, and that in his name they had caſt out diuels:</hi> whom notwithſtanding he would reiect as meer naturall and wicked men, ſaying vnto them, <hi>I neuer knew you, depart from me ye workers of iniquity. Mat.</hi> 7. 22. 23. what ſhal we ſay of ſuch men, ſo highly accounted of in the world? ſo greatly aduanced? ſo deeply learned, euen in diuinity? and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great things? Are they all vnwiſe? Are they all without vnderſtanding? Are they all fooles? yea verily: the Scripture and God himſelfe that is only wiſe, and knoweth beſt what men are, hath ſo pronounced of them. Man therefore neede not feare to giue the like ſentence and iudgement of ſuch, ſo long as they continue naturall and wicked men themſelues, though they conuert, and make neuer ſo many other wiſe and righteous. Such ſentence and iudgement, is not the ſentence and iudgement of man, but of God.</p>
               <p>This appeareth by the deſcription of true wiſedome in the word of God. For <hi>Paul</hi> by oppoſing the word <hi>vnwiſe, to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18428:60"/> of the will of the Lord,</hi> and ſaying: <hi>Be not vnwiſe, but vnderſtand what the will of the Lord is, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 17. doth plainly teach true wiſedome to be vnderſtanding the will of the Lord, and that all that doe not vnderſtand, what the will of the Lord is, are vnwiſe. But what will of the Lord doth the Apoſtle meane? Only that that is reuealed in his word. Therefore it is ſaid that the teſtimony of the Lord <hi>giueth wiſedome vnto the ſimple. Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. and that the ſcriptures (that is, the word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) <hi>are able to make men wiſe to ſaluation. 2. Tim.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
               <p>Therefore alſo <hi>the feare of the Lord (which is the keeping of Gods commandements. Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 13.) is often called <hi>the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of wiſedome,</hi> or <hi>the chiefe and moſt principall wiſedome. Iob 28. 28. Pſal. 111. 10. Pro.</hi> 1. 7. Yea, the truth is, that there is no good and ſound policy for the gouernment of kingdomes and common wealths, but by the word of God. Therefore in this very caſe the Prophet ſpeaketh thus, to the Prieſts, and Prophets, and Doctors of the Law, that tooke vpon them to be politicians and ſtates men without the word of God: <hi>They haue reiected the word of the Lord, and what wiſedome is in them? Ierem.</hi> 8. 9.</p>
               <p>So when <hi>Saul</hi> had made more haſte then good ſpeed in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſacrifice before <hi>Samuels</hi> comming, and that contrary to <hi>Samuels</hi> direction in that behalfe, <hi>Samuel</hi> feared not to tell him, <hi>that he had done fooliſhly, becauſe hee had not kept the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God: and that the Lord would haue ſtabliſhed his kingdome for euer: but that now his kingdome ſhould not continue, &amp;c. 1. Sam.</hi> 13. 13. 14. Becauſe alſo <hi>Aſa,</hi> (though otherwiſe a worthy king) had made a couenant with <hi>Benbadad</hi> king of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> to aide him againſt <hi>Baaſha</hi> King of Iſrael, <hi>Hanani the Seer,</hi> did rebuke him in the very ſame termes, telling him <hi>that hee had done fooliſhly, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Samuel</hi> had reproued <hi>Saul: 2. Chro.</hi> 16. 9. If therefore they were iuſtly charged to haue done fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they had done that which they did againſt the commandement of God: then by the ſame reaſon, all naturall men be no better then fooles, for aſmuch as they doe all neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and contemne the commandements of God.</p>
               <p>The ſame is further manifeſt, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> exhorteth the Iſraelites to the keeping of Gods commandements by this
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18428:61"/> argument, <hi>that they ſhould be their wiſedome and their vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the ſight of the people; which hearing all thoſe ordinances ſhould ſay, Onely this people is wiſe and of vnderſtanding. Deut.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, <hi>Chriſt Ieſus is called the wiſedome of his father, Luk.</hi> 11. 49. he is ſaid, <hi>to haue all the treaſures of wiſedome and of knowledge hid in him: Coloſſ. 2. 3. Vpon him the ſpirit of wiſedome and vnderſtanding, the ſpirit of counſell and ſtrength, the ſpirit of knowledge, and of the feare of the Lord doth reſt, Iſai.</hi> 11. 2.</p>
               <p>Where the vniting the ſpirit of wiſedome, vnderſtanding, <note place="margin">Note.</note> counſell and knowledge, with the ſpirit of feare, doth teach, that where there is not the ſpirit of feare, but the ſpirit of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſecurity, preſumption, and other impiety, there is not the ſpirit of wiſedome, of vnderſtanding, of counſell, or of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny true knowledge, according to that before ſaid in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe; <hi>He hath the ſeuen ſpirits of God in his hand Reuel.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 2. that is, all the gifts of the ſpirit of God: which though he be but one in his eſſence, 1. <hi>Cor. 12. 11. Eph.</hi> 4. 4. yet is called ſeuen in reſpect of the diuerſity of his gifts, and more ſpecially becauſe of the ſeuen Churches, to which he writeth thoſe ſeuen E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles: and yet all that variety of gifts is called by the name of ſpirits, becauſe one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit worketh them all, or diſtributeth them all, as the former place to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans witneſſeth. As therefore none could haue any corne in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt but by the hands of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> ſo Chriſt Ieſus is the high Lord Treaſurer of heauen for the diſpenſing of all the gifts of the ſpirit; in reſpect where of none can haue any but ſuch only <hi>as come to his gates and giue attendance at the poſts of his dores. Pro.</hi> 8. 33.</p>
               <p>To comprehend all the arguments hitherto vſed in one, thus I argue againſt all naturall and wicked men: They that haue not the vnderſtanding of Gods will reuealed in his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word: They that feare not the Lord in keeping his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: They that are without Chriſt Ieſus, are vtterly voide of true wiſedome, and therefore be ſtarke fooles. All na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and wicked men are without vnderſtanding of Gods will reuealed in his written word; They feare not God in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his commandements, and they are without Chriſt: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18428:61"/> they are vtterly void of true wiſedom and be ſtark fooles.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall reply and ask how it can be that all before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned (naturall and wicked men) may be ſaid to be without knowledge, or vnderſtanding: I anſwer as before, with additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notwithſtanding of <hi>Iohns</hi> words: <hi>He that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandements is a lyar, and the truth is not in him. 1. Ioh.</hi> 2. 4. For indeed how can any man ſay that hee knoweth God to be moſt iuſt, almighty, and able to be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of euery ſinne againſt him, and yet dareth to breake his commandements? And how can any man ſay that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God to be moſt wiſe, moſt gratious, moſt kind, moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and long ſuffering, and yet doth not loue him? Or how can he ſay he loueth him, and keepeth not his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 15. It is therefore moſt certaine, that no man doth truly know God, that doth not loue and obey him.</p>
               <p>But let vs ſhew the former point (all naturall men to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and fooliſh) by ſome other reaſons. Thus therefore I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. True wiſedome maketh them that haue it the better. All naturall and wicked men are no whit the better for all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and other knowledge they haue. They loſe all that they do according to ſuch learning and knowledge. They get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereby but onely heape vp the more iudgement and condemnation to themſelues. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 47. Therefore conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they are vnwiſe and fooles. Doe we not ſo account of men in the world? viz. that they are very ſimple men, and of no vnderſtanding, yea, ſtarke fooles, that ſhall altogether bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie themſelues, and ſpend their time, their ſtrength, and their wits, and their mony about matters of no profit? or that ſhall toile and moile, early and late for trifles, and neglect matters of moment, &amp; great worth? The beſt we ſay of ſuch is, <hi>that they are penny wiſe, and pound fooliſh.</hi> Why then may we not ſo iudge and ſpeak of naturall men, &amp; of all continuing in their natural condition, which (as was ſaid before by <hi>Iſaiah) lay out ſiluer and not for bread, and labor and be not ſatisfied? Iſai.</hi> 55. 2. and which follow altogether <hi>vaine things</hi> (as <hi>Samuel</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>which ſhall not profit them? 1. Sa.</hi> 12. 21. For certainly when they haue done al that they can, yet it may be ſaid to them as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh to the Romanes, <hi>What fruit haue you in thoſe things? Rom.</hi> 621.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18428:62"/> Yea, though they ſhould get neuer ſo much honour, and wealth in the world, yea, though they ſhould <hi>winne the whole world, yet what profit ſhall they haue, if they loſe their owne ſoules? Mark.</hi> 8 36. May not God ſay vnto ſuch (for all their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for wiſedome, &amp;c.) as he ſaid to the rich man, that hauing great increaſe of corne, took care only for building his barnes greater, and liuing after in pleaſures, and neuer thought of any thankfulneſſe to God or of doing any good with his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vnto men, <hi>O foole? &amp;c. Luk.</hi> 12. 20.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, as the word before tranſlated <hi>vnwiſe, Eph. 5. 17. Tit.</hi> 3. 3. and <hi>fooliſh, Galat.</hi> 3. 1. ſignifieth mad men: ſo in truth naturall men are no better then thoſe whom for diſtraction or loſſe of their naturall wits, we account mad men; yea, many diſtracted in their wits, or bereaued of their vnderſtanding, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by abundance of melancholy, or by feares, or by ſome accident, or by age, &amp;c. are in a far better ſtate for the life to come then meere naturall men, ſo long as they doe ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. For I doubt not but that the very deere children of God regenerated by the ſpirit, and beleeuing in Ieſus Chriſt, are ſubiect to that outward calamity as well as other; and as well as themſelues are ſubiect to other diſeaſes ariſing of naturall cauſes: and yet <hi>The foundation of God remaineth firme touching them: The Lord knoweth who are his. 2. Tim.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>That it is ſo, that is, that naturall men (whiles they be ſuch) are no better in their ſaid naturall ſtate, then mad men, yea, and that they are poſſeſt with a ſpirituall phrenſie, or that at leaſt they are no better then ſuch as we call idiots or naturals, I make plaine by theſe furtherreaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the prodigall child began to conſider of his waies, and to bethinke himſelfe of returning to his father, then he is ſaid, <hi>to haue come to himſelfe. Luk.</hi> 15. 17. The prodigall ſonne therefore repreſenting the ſtate of all vnregenerate men, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is ſignified, that as before his returne and ſubmiſſion to his Father he was no better, then as a man beſide himſelfe, and out of his wits, ſo all are the like before regeneration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All that make more account of bels and bables, of counters and rattles, and of ſuch other triffles, then they doe of ſiluer and gold, &amp;c. are no better then mad men, or at leaſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18428:62"/> then naturall fooles.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All that refuſe meat, drinke, and apparell (eſpecially of the beſt ſort) for their bodies and for this life, are no better then mad men, or at leaſt then naturall fooles.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All that do continually hurt and wound themſelues, and that ſeeke by all meanes to deſtroy themſelues, are no better then mad men, or at leaſt then naturall fooles.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All that put no difference betwixt any men but account all alike, and that eſpecially regard the meaneſt more then the greateſt, and their enemies more then their friends, and that will be aduiſed rather by fooles then by wiſe men, are no better themſelues then mad men, or at leaſt then naturall fooles.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All that wilfully tranſgreſſe the lawfull commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Kings, and ſo ſinne againſt their owne ſoules, are no better then mad men, or at leaſt then naturall fooles.</p>
               <p n="7">7. All that will not be kept within any bounds, but breake off all bonds, are no better then mad men, at leaſt then natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fooles.</p>
               <p>Such are all naturall and wicked men, ſo long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in that ſtate and condition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They make more account of the riches, honours, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and pleaſures of this world, then they doe of the moſt pretious word of God, and of the things that belong to the life to come, in reſpect whereof all things in this world are no better then traſh and dung.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They refuſe Chriſt Ieſus, and all other things pertaining to their ſaluation in him, offered vnto them in the word, as meat, and drinke, and apparell for their ſoules, of farre more worth then all meat, and drinke, and apparell for their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They doe daily hurt and wound their owne ſoules, and ſeeke by all meanes euerlaſtingly to deſtroy themſelues, euen by ſo many ſinnes as they doe daily commit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They account no better of one man then of another: at leaſt they account beſt of them that are the moſt vile: They doe more regard and feare ſimple, ſilly, weake, and mortall men, then they doe the moſt wiſe, mighty, fearefull, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18428:63"/> God: and haue the enemies of their ſaluation, which ſooth them vp in ſinne, and prouoke them daily thereunto by words and by example, in more eſtimation, and they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aduiſed by flattering worldlings (ſuch as ſauor only the things of the world, not the things of God.) then they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their moſt true hearted friends, that vnfeinedly wiſh, and by all meanes (admonition, counſell, reprehenſion, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and praier) doe ſeeke and endeauour their ſaluation, or then they will be aduiſed by ſuch as are wiſe in the Lord.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They doe euery day wilfully tranſgreſſe the moſt holy and iuſt commandements of the moſt holy and righteous God, and ſo doe more and more prouoke his indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelues, that is the king of kings.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They will not be kept within any compaſſe, they will not be directed in the way that leadeth to eternall life, but breake ouer hedge and ditch out of that way: and they ſpeake as the heathen did of whom the Prophet writeth, ſaying: <hi>Let vs breake their bonds, and caſt their cords from vs. Pſal.</hi> 2. 3. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may well conclude them all to be no better then mad men, or at leaſt then naturall fooles.</p>
               <p>They indeed doe ſo account of the moſt excellent ſeruants of God. For ſo was the Prophet termed that annointed <hi>Iehu</hi> to be king of Iſrael, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 11. So did <hi>Feſtus</hi> call <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſpake moſt excellently of heauenly things. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 24. and ſo naturall and worldly men doe daily caſt this reprochfull name vpon the beſt children of God, eſteeming them no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a company of fooles, and mad men: but the truth is, that this belongeth to themſelues, and they ſpecially are the fooles, and mad men of the world, as the former arguments do demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>Let no man ſo wreſt my words, as to vnderſtand me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne naturall wit, and vnderſtanding, or policy, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp;c. I doe not condemne them, but acknowledge them in themſelues to be the good gifts of God. Notwithſtanding ſuch is the corruption of nature before and without regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that meere naturall men not knowing how to vſe them, doe therefore abuſe them, the more to the diſhonour of God, and to the encreaſe of their own condemnation, euen as men
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18428:63"/> reaued of their naturall wits hauing a ſword put into their hands or any other thing (good in it ſelfe) committed vnto them, do rather abuſe all to the hurt of themſelues and other, then do any good at all therewith.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of all theſe things hitherto handled, as it is ſaid of images <hi>that they are laid ouer with gold and ſiluer, and there is no breath in them, Hab.</hi> 2. 19. ſo it may beſaid of meer naturall men touching the life of God, that how trim and gay ſoeuer they be in the world, and how great and glorious ſoeuer they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by their wit, or learning, or policie, &amp;c. yet indeed they haue no breath at all of that life in them, neither any ſparke of true wiſedome. How baſe therefore is their ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? yea, how fearfull and lamentable? For who doth not pity the ſtate of mad men, and of ſuch as by any meanes haue loſt their wits? Many carnall men (I grant) doe carnally make a ſport of mad men and naturall fooles: they make themſelues merry with ſuch (as the Philiſtims abuſed the blindneſſe of <hi>Sampſon</hi> and vſed him therefore to play before them, and to make them paſtime, in their great meeting, and in their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to <hi>Dagon</hi> their God. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 16. 25) Many (I ſay) doe euen ſo abuſe the ſimplicity and lamentable madneſſe of other to make themſelues merry, but they ſhould rather vſe ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples as glaſſes wherein to behold the iudgement of God vpon ſuch, that may (perhaps more iuſtly) fall vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Therefore euery time they looke vpon ſuch they ſhould feare and tremble, leſt God ſmite them with the like: yea they ſhould be thankfull to God, and conſider of his goodneſſe in ſparing them ſo long, whereas hee might haue made them ſuch as thoſe are, and thoſe as witty naturally as themſelues. In which reſpect alſo they ſhould be the more carefull to vſe their naturall wit and vnderſtanding the more to Gods glory. <hi>Achiſh</hi> king of <hi>Gath,</hi> (though a naturall man, a wicked man, and an heathen man) when <hi>Dauid was brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his preſence, and fained himſelfe mad before him, ſcrabling vpon the dores of the gate, and letting his ſpittle fall down vpon his beard</hi> (in driueling ſort) <hi>ſaid vnto his ſeruants, lo, the man is beſide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, wherefore haue ye brought him vnto me? Haue I need of mad men, that ye haue brought this fellow to play the mad man in my
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18428:64"/> preſence: Shall he come into mine houſe? 1. Sam</hi> 21. 13. 14. 15. So little pleaſure did <hi>Achiſh</hi> take in ſuch: ſo far was he from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelfe merry with ſuch, and from laughter at their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, that hee was highly offended with them, that had brought him before him. Hereby then we ſee how odious a thing madneſſe is. And indeed though ſome fooliſhly take pleaſure in the fooliſhneſſe and madneſſe of other, yet tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching themſelues, who abhorreth not the name of a foole? and who feareth not the ſtate of madneſſe? And who (I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine) not altogether void of reaſon himſelfe, eſpecially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any ſparke of grace, doth not pitty both them that are voide of naturall vnderſtanding, and alſo them, that hauing had reaſon (for ſome ſecret cauſe) are depriued thereof (with <hi>Nabuchadnezar)</hi> and poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of phrenſie? Oh then what can be ſaid of ſpirituall ſimplicity, and of ſpirituall madneſſe?</p>
               <p>The more wofull therefore and fearfull theſe things are, the greater is the dignity of the children of God, who onely are enlightned, and haue the eies of their mindes opened to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the excellent wiſedome of God; yea, who alſo are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers thereof. For as Chriſt is before generally ſhewed to be their life, ſo particularly he is their light, their vnderſtanding, and wiſedome. For therefore is he called (as we haue heard) <hi>the ſunne of righteouſneſſe, Malac.</hi> 4. 2. and, <hi>the light of the world. Ioh.</hi> 8. 12. and 9. 5. yea, (that it may the better appeare that life and light goe together) he is in one place called both <hi>life and light, Ioh.</hi> 1. 4. As therefore the children of God being partaker of Chriſt, cannot but be partaker alſo of life, ſo they muſt be alſo partaker of light: If they be in the light, and the light in them, how can they be in darkneſſe? The like is to be ſaid of knowledge and wiſedome: For Chriſt being the wiſedome of his father, hauing all the treaſures of wiſedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in him, and hauing the ſpirit of wiſedome, knowledge, and vnderſtanding, yea, hauing all the ſeuen ſpirits of God (as hath been ſhewed) it muſt needs be that they that haue him, haue alſo true knowledge, and true wiſedome. If they that haue him not neither haue life, nor light, nor knowledge, and that becauſe they haue not him: then it muſt needs follow
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18428:64"/> that they that haue him, haue alſo all thoſe; and that becauſe they haue him, and ſo far as they haue him. Therefore Chriſt is ſaid to be made vnto them not only <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> but alſo <hi>wiſedome, 1. Cor.</hi> 1. 30. So then, as all new borne being incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into Chriſt, are alſo partaker of his wiſedome: ſo alſo all that are out of Chriſt are alſo without wiſedome. Therefore our Sauiour ſpeaking of his children, ſaith, that <hi>to them onely it is giuen to know the ſecrets of the kingdome of God. Mat. 13. 11. Which are hid from the wiſe and from men of vnderſtanding. Mat.</hi> 11. 25. viz. from them that are worldly wiſe: and who being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>the fleſh doe ſauor the things only of the fleſh: Rom.</hi> 8. 5.</p>
               <p>If alſo the feare of the Lord be (as we haue heard) <hi>the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of wiſedome,</hi> and that wiſedome doe conſiſt in keeping Gods commandements, then all that are new borne, and ſo clenſed from their ſinnes, and ſanctified to the feare of God, cannot but in that reſpect alſo be wiſe: the rather becauſe it is expreſly ſaid, that <hi>whoſoeuer is borne of God, ſinneth not, neither can ſinne, &amp;c. Ioh. 3. 8. Dauid</hi> teſtifieth that by keeping Gods commandements, &amp;c. God had made <hi>him wiſer then his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: of more vnderſtanding then all his teachers: and then the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. Pſal.</hi> 119. 98. 100. Though euery one of the children of God cannot thus compare for wiſedome with their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and ancients, yet they may with their aduerſaries: yea, why not alſo with their ancients and teachers, if ſuch be not regenerated? For they that know the will of God and doe it, are more learned Doctors (though otherwiſe they be but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple men, yea, not booke learned, viz. not able to read) then all other great doctors in the world, yea, then al doctors in diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that are able to teach other, and doe teach other, and yet doe not themſelues the things which they teach other. For <hi>hereby</hi> (as we haue heard) <hi>are we ſure that we know him</hi> (viz. truly and rightly) <hi>if we keepe his commandements. He that ſaith he knoweth him, and keepeth not his commandements is a lyar, and the truth is not in him. 1. Ioh.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p>Such great Doctors therefore as haue knowledge without obedience according to their knowledge, doe indeed know nothing as they ſhould. For what are they the better by the knowledge of any thing, if they know not him rightly that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18428:65"/> knoweth all things, and in the right knowledge <hi>of whom, and of Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne, whom he hath ſent, is eternall life. Ioh.</hi> 17. 3.</p>
               <p>Now touching the excellency of knowledge and wiſedome, and thereby alſo of the ſtate and condition of Gods children, as it appeareth by the metaphors before vſed, ſo the ſame is further manifeſt by many teſtimonies of Scripture. <hi>Iob</hi> mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth wiſedome aboue gold and ſiluer, and <hi>the wedge of gold: aboue cryſtall, and the plate of fine gold: aboue the corall, and the pretious pearles, aboue the topaz of Ethiopia, and the wedge</hi> (againe) <hi>of pure gold, &amp;c. Iob. 28. 15. &amp;c. Salomon</hi> extolletn it aboue <hi>the merchandiſe of ſiluer, the gaine of gold, and aboue pearles;</hi> yea, he ſaith that <hi>all things that a man can deſire are not to bee compared vnto her, &amp;c. Pro. 13. 14. 15. &amp;c.</hi> Where alſo it is commended by diuers excellent fruits, <hi>as by the length of daies, riches, glorie, pleaſures eternall life and bleſſedneſſe.</hi> It is in like manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. 10. 11. and 16. 16. In another place, he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it before <hi>ſtrength and weapons of warre: Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 16. 18. where in the latter compariſon, the oppoſition he maketh of <hi>wiſedome</hi> is to be obſerued, viz. that he ſaith not <hi>but one foole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroieth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>much good.</hi> but that he ſaith, <hi>but one ſinner destroieth much good:</hi> ſo he ſheweth his meaning by wiſedome to be ſuch wiſedome, as whereby men take heed of ſinne, and that (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my former writing) all ſinners are fooles; whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it accordeth that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith not, <hi>The wicked man,</hi> or <hi>the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> but, <hi>The foole hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God. Pſal.</hi> 14. 1. and 53. 1. by the foole meaning the ſinner and the wicked man.</p>
               <p>Againe, what was it that firſt deceiued our firſt mother <hi>Eue?</hi> was it not a falſe hope of further knowledge? doth not this therefore ſhew that knowledge is a thing much to be deſired? and that true knowledge is highly to be eſteemed? Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſe that he accounted all things loſſe, yea, as very dung: euen a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>All theſe things doe plainly ſhew the great dignity of the children of God in reſpect of the ſaid knowledge and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

               <argument>
                  <p>Of ſome other branches of the former life of God, in all new borne, viz. of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe both generally, and alſo in ſomeparticulars.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>ET vs now proceede to ſome other points, both of the life of God before mentioned, and alſo conſequently of the further matter of our regeneration, and new birth; that is, of other things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſaid new birth and regeneration doth conſiſt; and that according to our former method in this point, viz. of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of contraries. Here therefore let vs remember that before ſaid, namely that euen when men are dead in their ſinnes and vtterly voide of the life of God (before handled) then they are aliue vnto ſinne. Being ſo aliue vnto ſinne they are likewiſe ſeruants, not only thereunto, but alſo to ſatan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <hi>For to whomſoeuer we giue our ſelues as ſeruants to obey, his ſeruants we are. Rom. 6. 16. Iob. 8. 34. 2. Pet.</hi> 2. 19. This ſeruice is the greateſt ſlauery and bondage of all other: far greater then the bondage of the Iſraelites in the houſe of bondage, in the land of Egypt: becauſe that was with ſuch feeling that it wrought great heauineſſe in them, and many praiers and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſires to be releaſed thereof. But this bondage is ſuch by the meanes of ſpirituall death, that there is no ſenſe at all ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the heauineſſe of ſinne (as hath been before ſhewed) or of the bitterneſſe thereof: yea, though for bitterneſſe no wormewood nor gall be comparable to it, yet they thinke it as ſweet as hony and the hony combe: yea, ſuch delight and pleaſure doe they take therein, that they <hi>commit the ſame with greedineſſe. Eph.</hi> 4. 19. Therefore being offered liberty with moſt gracious conditions, they will by no meanes accept thereof.</p>
               <p>Fearefull therefore in this behalfe is the eſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18428:66"/> of all men by nature: yea, hereby alſo doth that the better appeare which before I handled, concerning the naturall foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe and madneſſe of men. For who but fooles and mad men could beare ſuch burdens as ſinnes are, without ſenſe and feeling? As therefore the very Philoſophers accounted ſuch ſottiſh and ſenſeleſſe perſons for ſeruants by nature: ſo this ſeruile and ſlauiſh condition of all men by nature, is the more fitly handled in this place, next to that before of the fooliſhneſſe and madneſſe of all naturall men, becauſe it is an effect or at leaſt a conſequent thereof. But what is the ſtate of men by Ieſus Chriſt in their regeneration? Truly a moſt ſweet and gratious liberty and freedome. For as Chriſt is made <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſo alſo <hi>is he made redemption vnto vs. 1. Cor.</hi> 1. 30. and often doe we read that Chriſt hath redeemed vs. <hi>Tit. 2. 14. Galat. 3. 13. 1. Pet.</hi> 1. 19. and often elſewhere. Our Sauiour himſelfe ſaith, that <hi>If men did continue in his word,</hi> then they ſhould ſhew themſelues <hi>to be his diſciples indeed, and they ſhould know the truth, and the truth ſhould make them free. Ioh.</hi> 8. 32. and againe, <hi>If the ſonne ſhall make you free you ſhall be free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> verſ. 36. He meaneth in this place, freedome from the yoke, bondage, and extreme ſlauery of ſinne. When <hi>Peter</hi> had anſwered our Sauiour that Princes tooke toll or cuſtome of ſtrangers, our Sauiour replieth, <hi>then are the children free. Mat.</hi> 17. 26. That which our Sauiour ſpeaketh in that caſe, may be much more vnderſtood in this whereof now we ſpeake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſpeake of the children of God.</p>
               <p>What Prince of power to deliuer, will ſuffer his ſubiects, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially his children, to be in bondage and captiuity? How then can it be, that God being of all power, ſhould ſuffer his children to be in bondage? eſpecially ſo great a bondage as the bondage of ſinne?</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding being freed from the ſeruitude of ſinne, we are made the ſeruants of righteouſneſſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 18. But this ſeruice is perfect freedome. When any child, eſpecially the ſonne of a Prince, hauing been in captiuity to ſome enemies, is freed from the ſaid captiuity, doth he account it any bondage to ſerue his Father and ſoueraigne? No it is his liberty and great honor that he may ſerue him. When men therefore are
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18428:66"/> freed from the bondage of ſinne and Satan, how great is their liberty, how vnſpeakable is their honour, to ſerue their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, the king of kings? It is not poſſible to ſerue God in holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, till firſt we be deliuered from our enemies. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 74. 75. As a man loaden with many fetters and irons, cannot in any thing ſerue his Prince, till his ſaid fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and irons, be knocked off; ſo no man can ſerue God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept firſt he be diſcharged from the bolts and fetters of ſinne, ten thouſand times more heauy then any irons. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the place before alledged, that Chriſt <hi>gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for vs,</hi> firſt, <hi>that he might redeeme vs from all iniquity;</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that he might purge vs;</hi> and thirdly, <hi>to be a peculiar people vnto himſelfe, zealous of good workes. Tit</hi> 2. 14. We cannot therefore be zealous of good works, except firſt we be redeemed from the guilt of all iniquity, and purged from the blemiſh, and freed from the bondage thereof.</p>
               <p>This our freedome likewiſe and liberty is ſignified by that which before was alleged, that <hi>he that is borne of God, ſinneth not, neither can ſinne, becauſe the ſeed of God abideth in him. 1. Ioh.</hi> 3. 8. that is, ſinne hath not dominion ouer him as before it had: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can haue: becauſe being once freed, he ſhall neuer returne into the bondage thereof: neither doth hee ſinne with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light therein ſo far foorth as hee is regenerated and borne of God. That ſinne wherewith at any time he is ouertaken, is but a ſuddain paſſion of the old man remaining in him: ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God himſelfe to preuaile in ſome things, as for ſome reaſons before mentioned, ſo alſo for ſome afterward to be ſpoken of. By denying alſo the new borne of God to ſinne, the Apoſtle inſinuateth that ſeruing of God, <hi>in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe</hi> which was before touched: and ſo the word not <hi>to ſinne,</hi> is taken by our Sauiour, when he ſaith to the man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his limbs, <hi>Sinne no more, leſt a worſe thing happen vnto thee. Ioh.</hi> 5. 14. He meaneth not onely that he ſhould abſtaine from the euils forbidden, but that alſo he ſhould performe the things required in the law of God. For the law of God ſaying not only <hi>Eſchew euill,</hi> but alſo <hi>Doe good: Pſal.</hi> 34. 14. he muſt be a tranſgreſſor of the law, not only that doth commit the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill forbidden, but alſo that neglecteth or omitteth the good
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18428:67"/> commanded. So the diſtinction <hi>of ſinnes of commisſion, and of ſinnes of omisſion</hi> is as ſound and true, as it is ancient and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
               <p>As God himſelfe is not only free from all euill, but infinit alſo in all goodneſſe: ſo his law is like himſelfe, and doth as well command that which is <hi>holy and iuſt,</hi> as it forbiddeth all <hi>vnholineſſe, and vnrighteouſneſſe.</hi> According to this law men ſhall be condemned, and that moſt iuſtly, as well for leauing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done good duties, as for perpetrating &amp; acting of thoſe things that are euill. It is not ſaid, <hi>That euery tree that bringeth forth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill fruit,</hi> but <hi>which bringeth not forth good fruit ſhal be bewen down</hi> (or ſtubbed vp by the roots) <hi>and caſt into the fire. Mat.</hi> 3. 10. And our Sauiour pronounceth ſentence of condemnation, for not viſiting the ſicke, entertaining the ſtrangers, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked &amp;c. <hi>Mat. 25. 41, &amp;c.</hi> By condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning notwithſtanding them that haue not done good, he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that much more they ſhal be condemned, that do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that which is euill. <hi>Mat. 12. 36. 37. 1. Cor. 6. 9. Reuel.</hi> 21. 8. and 22. 15. So then this freedome of Gods children, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a releaſe from the moſt grieuous ſeruitude of ſinne, but alſo a participation of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. Without this holineſſe and righteouſneſſe our life before ſpoken of were no life; neither were our freedome any freedome, at leaſt not worth the hauing. The ſoule of man may be as well without motion in the body, as the life of God without the fruits of righteouſneſſe. That which is ſpoken of faith <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 20. is true alſo of the life of God. What freedome alſo of any city is without commodities belonging thereunto? But of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</p>
               <p>This alſo touching the fruits of righteouſneſſe, is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in reſpect of the knowledge and wiſedome before handled. For how can a man be accounted a man of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wiſedome, that ſheweth not the ſame by his workes of knowledge and wiſedome? And indeed we haue heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that our knowledge and wiſedome conſiſteth in the feare of God, and keeping of his commandements. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribeth that excellent knowledge of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of, to be not the knowledge of his natures, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18428:67"/> perſon onely as they are things in Chriſt himſelfe, but as they are effectuall in other, both to iuſtification, and alſo to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification by the power of his death, and the vertue of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; of the one to our releaſe from that bondage of ſinne before handled; and of the other, to the quickning of vs to newneſſe of life. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 8. 9. 10. Therefore alſo Chriſt in the place before diuers times alledged, is ſaid to be made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs not only <hi>wiſedome, righteouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>redemption,</hi> but alſo <hi>ſanctification, 1. Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Therefore without Chriſt no more ſanctification, then wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, or redemption. In this reſpect, Chriſt is not only ſaid to haue giuen himſelfe for vs, that we might be pure or purged, and holy or ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: theſe things (I ſay) are not ſpoken in the nowne, or in the verbe paſſiue, as if either we or ſome other might purge and ſanctifie vs, but in the actiue verb, <hi>that he might purge vs, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>Tit. 2. 14. and that he might ſanctifie his Church, &amp;c. Epo.</hi> 5. 26. to teach, that the purging and ſanctifying of vs is the worke on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Chriſt, as well as the redeeming, ſauing, and iuſtifying of vs. The ſame is yet further taught by our Sauiour himſelfe; <hi>As the branch cannot beare fruit of it ſelfe, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me:</hi> and againe; <hi>without me ye can doe nothing,</hi> viz. that good is. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 3. 4. 5. and <hi>Paul</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſaith, that <hi>the fruits of righteouſneſſe are by Ieſus Chriſt. Phil.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
               <p>All this is to be vnderſtood of Chriſt, not as God only but as God and man, the mediator betwixt God and man, and as in that reſpect he is the head of the Church, and ſo communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his vertue to all in regeneration incorporated into him, and in whom he dwelleth by faith, euen as the naturall head of a naturall body, communicateth the vertue thereof to all the members of all the ſaid naturall body. So that alſo is to bee vnderſtood, <hi>that of his fulneſſe we doe all receiue grace for grace:</hi> or <hi>grace vpon grace,</hi> or grace after grace. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
               <p>All hitherto ſpoken of our life, of our knowledge, and wiſedome, of our redemption, freedome, and liberty, and of our ſanctification, and holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe (as the matter of our regeneration, and things wherein the <note place="margin">Note.</note>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:18428:68"/> ſame doth conſiſt) muſt be vnderſtood to be by Ieſus Chriſt in a double reſpect: firſt in that he hath purchaſed them for vs by the ſame price which hee gaue for our ſelues and for our ſaluation. Secondly, by working them in vs himſelfe, being apprehended by a true and liuely faith: as hath been ſhewed before by the ſimilitude of the vine and the branches, and of the head and the members.</p>
               <p>Moreouer touching this holineſſe and righteouſneſſe now in hand, we muſt vnderſtand, that it muſt not only be inward, but alſo outward: not in heart alone, but alſo in our outward man, and in our outward behauiour. For <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>that they may ſee your good workes, and glorifie your father which is in heauen. Mat. 5. 16. Clenſe your ſelues</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and of the ſpirit, that ye may grow vp to full holineſſe. 2. Cor.</hi> 7. 1. he ſpeaketh not only of filthineſſe of the fleſh, but alſo of the ſpirit: and therefore the holineſſe there commended, and oppoſed to the former filthineſſe, muſt be anſwerable thereuno viz. of the fleſh, that is, of the body, as well as of the ſpirit and heart. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth them to whom he did write, not only <hi>as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and pilgrims to abſtaine from fleſhly luſts becauſe they fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſoules,</hi> but alſo <hi>to haue their conuerſation</hi> (namely their outward conuerſation) <hi>honeſt among the Gentiles, that they which did ſpeake euill of them as of euill doers, might by their good works which they ſhould ſee glorifie God in the day of their viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 1. Pet: 2. 11. 12. Iames</hi> biddeth not only <hi>to purge our hearts, but alſo to clenſe our hands. Iames</hi> 4. 8. The Apoſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes teacheth, that <hi>none can draw neere to God in full aſſurance of faith,</hi> but only ſuch as <hi>whoſe bodies are as well waſhed with pure water, as their hearts are purged from an euill conſcience. Heb.</hi> 10. 22. that is, ſuch as are ſanctified as well in their outward beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, as touching their vnderſtanding, iudgement, thoughts, memory, and affections.</p>
               <p>This well agreeth with all before ſaid of our faith, of our life, of our knowledge, and wiſedome. <hi>The faith which is without workes is dead. Iames</hi> 2. 17. and 20. and againe betwixt both, viz. verſ. 18. <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy workes. With the heart man beleeueth vnto righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth man confeſſeth
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18428:68"/> to ſaluation. Rom.</hi> 10. 10. by confeſſion of the mouth he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the acknowledgement and profeſſion of Chriſt in all our outward behauiour. To the ſame purpoſe the Apoſtle alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I beleeued, therfore I ſpake,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>We alſo beleeued, and therefore ſpeake. Pſal. 116. 10. 2. Corinth.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The life of God</hi> before handled, hath been ſhewed not onely to be inward, but alſo to ſhew it ſelfe outwardly. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge alſo and wiſedome of God renewed in the regeneration of the children of God, hath been declared to conſiſt in the feare of God, and keeping of Gods commandements, which concerne as well the good cariage of all the parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our bodie, as the diſpoſition of our mindes and hearts.</p>
               <p>This holineſſe therefore and righteouſneſſe muſt be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the gouernment of euery member, of the eie, of the eare, of the mouth, of the hands, of the feet, and of the whole body according to the rules preſcribed in the word for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of euery ſuch member. I forbeare the particular confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of theſe things by ſhewing the particular ſcriptures for direction of euery particular member, becauſe the labor were too great for me the writer, and for any reader. For indeed it would require a whole volume by it ſelfe. Yea and <hi>Otho Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannus</hi> (in the beginning of this treatiſe mentioned) hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly and religiouſly performed this. For his book intituled <hi>Hominis Spiritualis anatomia, &amp;c. The anatomie of a ſpirituall man,</hi> is altogether of this argument. Whereunto the learned deſirous to ſee the former point more particularly and largely handled, may repaire.</p>
               <p>That this holineſſe and righteouſneſſe whereof now wee ſpeake (both inward and outward) is not alike in all that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, yea, that are of the ſame age in regeneration, I ſhall not need here to ſpeake; ſith that which hath been ſaid before in that behalfe of the life of God, doth alſo belong to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and righteouſneſſe, which are but effects or fruits of our ſaid life.</p>
               <p>Now let vs further vnderſtand, that as all other vertues are comprehended, vnder the former life, liberty, wiſedome, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18428:69"/> and righteouſneſſe, ſo ſpecially that ſobriety that is ſo commended in the ſcripture is a principall branch, as of all the former generally, ſo particularly of that wiſedome. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe the word tranſlated <hi>ſoberly, Tit.</hi> 2. 12. ſignifieth <hi>wiſely:</hi> and the like word tranſlated, <hi>Be ſober, 1. Pet.</hi> 4. 7. ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be <hi>wiſe:</hi> as alſo the word tranſlated <hi>modeſty,</hi> or <hi>ſobriety,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9. and 15. ſignifieth <hi>wiſedome;</hi> and the ſame word tranſlated <hi>ſoberneſſe</hi> or <hi>ſobriety,</hi> is oppoſed to the word that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <hi>being mad: Acts</hi> 26. 25. and 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 13.</p>
               <p>By all theſe places (wherein the holy ghoſt ſpeaking of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety vſeth a word that ſignifieth alſo wiſedome) we are taught that ſobriety is a ſpeciall point of true wiſedome.</p>
               <p>This ſobriety notwithſtanding that now we ſpeake of, is not only the moderation of our ſelues for drinke (which is appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to that foule ſinne of drunkenneſſe, in theſe daies too too common) neither that only which is in apparrell (contrary to the diſguiſed attiring of men and women, whereby the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of one country conforme themſelues to other countries, directly againſt Gods word, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 8. yea (like monſters), to other creatures; at leaſt one ſex to another, the women eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wearing mens apparell, and men ſuffering their haire to grow like to women; both directly alſo againſt the word, that <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 5. and this (as contrary to nature it ſelfe) 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. and whereby likewiſe the profeſſors of ſincerity conforme themſelues to the world, and to the vanity vſed by the world, which is to be vnderſtood as well forbidden by the Apoſtle in apparell as in other things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2.) Neither alſo is this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety (now ſpoken of) only that which is repugnant to other lightneſſe, either in countenance, or in geſture (condemned with the former of apparell: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3. 16. and by it ſelfe alone ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in all perſons by oppoſition thereunto of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſober and wiſe geſtured: <hi>Pro.</hi> 17 24. and more ſpecially in women as a tricke of harlots. <hi>Pro.</hi> 7. 13. This ſobriety (I ſay) doth not conſiſt only in theſe things, but it conſiſteth in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our ſelues, and of all our affections in any ſlate of life, (in proſperity and in aduerſity) that in the one we be not drunken with delights and pleaſures, with wealth and riches, with honors and preferments of this world: and that in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18428:69"/> other we be neither ſurfetted with cares and feares: nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome with ſorrowes and griefes: whereby (as drunken men) wee ſhould be vnfit for other dueties belonging vnto vs.</p>
               <p>He that is ſober in this manner, is a wiſe man indeed. And this ſobriety is the ſpring of all other holineſſe, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, or that which comprehendeth them both.</p>
               <p>All the other kinds of ſobriety, before rehearſed, are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but ſuch as may be, and oft times are, euen in meere natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men. Many naturall men, are as abſtemious from wine and all ſtrong drinke, and as far from all drunkenneſſe that way (I meane in their outward behauiour) as any other men. Many are as ſober in their apparell, and as graue and modeſt in their countenance, geſture, ſpeech, and all other behauiour, as any other: ſo that theſe kinds of ſobriety are not proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar only to the children of God, but common alſo to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But this ſobriety that conſiſteth in moderation of our ſelues and of our affections in euery ſtate of life, in proſperity and in aduerſity, eſpecially in ſuch ſort as the Scripture commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſame, is only in them that are new borne of the ſpirit of God, and by incorporation into Ieſus Chriſt, are made the ſonnes and daughters of God.</p>
               <p>They that are not new borne, in their <hi>proſperity, pride is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them as a chaine, and cruelty couereth them as agarment. Pſal. 73. 6. The wicked is ſo proud, &amp;c. that be thinketh there is no God. His waies proſper, &amp;c. therefore he deſieth all his enemies. He ſaith in his heart, he ſhall neuer be moued, &amp;c. His mouth is full of eur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and deceit, and fraude: Vnder his tongue is miſchiefe and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: he heth in wait in the villages: in the ſecret places hee doth murther the innocent: his eies are bent againſt the poore: He lieth in wait ſecretly, euen as a lion in denne: Hee lieth in wait to ſpotle the poore, when he draweth him into his net. Pſal. 10 56. 7. 8. 9. &amp;c.</hi> Yea, he had ſaid before in the ſame Pſalme, verſe 2. <hi>The wicked doth perſecnte the poore, &amp;c. he hath made boaſt of his owne hearts deſire, and contemneth the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No maruell then though ſuch contemne men eſpecially their inferious. And thus indeed wee daylie ſee, how
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18428:70"/> the wicked abuſe all the mercies of God, either by all in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perancy (as if they were abſolute Lords of all that they haue, and were not to giue any account to any) or by extreme pride and cruelty, carrying themſelues like Lords and Kings ouer other, ſcorning them, contemning them, and oppreſſing them at their pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But the children of God on the contrary, knowing that they are but for a time the Lords ftewards of all that they haue, vſe this world, and all things they haue in this world (honors, riches, authority, friends, &amp;c) as though they had them not: that is, they ſo poſſeſſe them, and ſo diſpoſe them, that they be no hinderances vnto them, but rather furtheran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them concerning the life to come. Therefore if <hi>they be rich in this world, they put not their truſt in vncertaine riches, but in the liuing God: and they be rich in good workes, diſtributing and communicating vnto other</hi> according to need: and <hi>ſo laying vp a ſure foundation to themſelues againſt the time to come, towards e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life 1. Tim. 6. 18. &amp;c. They eat not their bread alone, but the fatherleſſe eat thereofwith them. They ſee not any to periſh for want of clothing: nor the poore to goe without a couering: but doe cauſe their loines to bleſſe them. They lift not vp their hand againſt the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, when they ſee they may helpe them in the gate, &amp;c. Iob 31. 17. &amp;c. They make not their gold their hope: neither ſay they to the wedge of gold, thou art my confidence.</hi> verſ. 24. Thus did <hi>Iob.</hi> Thus did other that haue receiued the ſame ſpirit of adoption that <hi>Iob had.</hi> Is not this excellent wiſedome? ſo to prouide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards eternall life as before we heard? and ſo to make <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues friends with the riches of iniquity that when they ſhall want, they may be receiued into euer laſting habitations? Luk.</hi> 16. 9. Let the world account of this as they will. All they that vſe it, ſhall find it a principall part of wiſedome.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of their vſing authority and honours: not to the vexing or oppreſſing of any, but to the good and comfort of all. <hi>They open their mouth for the dumbe in the cauſe of the children of deſtruction: they open their mouth and iudge righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly: and iudge the afflicted and the poore. Pro. 31. 8. 9. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the poore that cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, and the father leſſe and him that hath none to helpe him. The bleſſing of them that are ready to periſh are vpon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18428:70"/> them, and they cauſe the widdowes heart to reioice. They put on iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and couer themſelues: Their iudgement is as a robe, and a crowne: They are eyes to the blind, and ſeet to the lame: They are fathers to the poore, and when they know not their cauſe, they ſeeke it out diligently. They breake the iawes of vnrighteous men, and plucke the prey out of their teeth. Iob 29. 12 &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the children of God goe vpright in their proſperity, they reele not neither ſtagger, either to the right hand or to the left hand (as drunke with their riches and honours) but walke on right in the way, that God hath laid out before them towalke in. But what doe they in aduerſity? The braines (as I may ſo ſpeake) of their mindes are no more diſtempered, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the affections of their hearts any more diſordered therewith, then before with proſperity. For they carry not themſelues as men without hope, but cheerfully and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably they looke to the cauſe in themſelues: to the hand from heauen that ſendeth the ſame: to the loue from which it doth proceed: to the end why it is ſent: they remember what a bleſſed end other haue had of the like afflictions: and they forget not what comfort themſelues haue had in former times in the like: perhaps alſo in greater dangers. According to theſe things they make ſuch vſe of all their afflictions, that they ſhall be able truly to ſay, <hi>It is good for vs that we haue been afflicted that we may learne thy ſtatutes. Pſal.</hi> 119. 71. So they neither be too much caſt down with that which the righteous Lord laieth vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: neither do they make too light account thereof. If they loſe all that euer they had, wealth, and honor, and friends in one day, they murmur not againſt God, but humble themſelues and ſay, <hi>Naked came we out of our mothers wombes, naked ſhall we returne thither: The Lord hath giuen; The Lord hath taken: Bleſſed be the name of the Lord. Iob</hi> 1. 21.</p>
               <p>This ſober &amp; cheerful cariage of themſelues in ſuch a ſtate, is the greater point of wiſedom, if we ſhal coſider how the wicked are either hardned like brawne, that they make no reckoning of it, yea, that they ſcarce feele it (as <hi>Belſhazaer</hi> in the midſt of his cups hearing that <hi>he was found too light, and that the Medes and Perſians ſhould</hi> come and take from him his kingdome, and his life, was not a whit moued with it, but in a brauery for all
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18428:71"/> that commanded <hi>Daniel</hi> to be <hi>clothed with purple, and to haue a chaiue of gold put about his necke, &amp;c. Dan.</hi> 5. 29) or elſe they are moued with it only for a time (as <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 27.) returning afterward to their former ſinnes that procured it: or els they fret and rage like mad men (as they are) not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt impatient towards all about them, but alſo blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the God of heauen himſelfe. But I will not ſtand vpon theſe things; being eſpecially more particularly handled by M. <hi>Rogers</hi> in his ſixt treatiſe, viz. of the priuiledges of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: and hauing my ſelfe ſome occaſion to ſpeake of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in this treatiſe. In the meane time we ſee the wicked in euery condition of life to reele and ſtagger like drunken men: in either of both conditions falling moſt dangerouſly: and (as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh of drunkards, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23. 29.) euery where meeting with <hi>woe, with ſorrow, with ſtrife, &amp;c. with wounds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of the children of God touching the moderation and ſobriety of all their affections, anger, ioy, greefe, loue, feare, &amp;c. in other matters: as alſo of the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the affections of the wicked.</p>
               <p>As the children of God are ſober (according to that before ſpoken) ſo likewiſe they are alwaies in ſuch ſort watchfull, that although <hi>the diuell their aduerſary compaſſe the earth to and fro, and walke about neuer ſo often. Iob</hi> 1. 7. and neuer ſo diligently, <hi>like a roaring Lion ſeeking whom he may deuoare,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. yet he doth not take them ſo napping, that he doth ſo preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as he doth againſt other: neither doth any euill ſo ouertake them, but that before hand they be in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure prepared for it.</p>
               <p>This watchfulneſſe is an effect of the ſaid ſobriety, as ſleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, drouſineſſe, and ſecurity is an effect of the contrary. For as it is in that ſobriety which conſiſteth in abſtaining from wine and ſtrong drinke, and in the contrary thereof, namely <hi>being drunken with wine wherein is exceſſe. Epheſ.</hi> 5. 18. viz. that the more ſober and abſtemious any man is, the more vigilant and watchfull alſo he is; yea, the apter for vigilancy and watchfulneſſe: and on the contrary, the more any man is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome with wine, or other ſtrong drinke, the more apt he is
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18428:71"/> to ſleepe; yea, the more heauy and drowſie: ſo the more ſober any man is touching the former moderation of himſelfe in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſtate and condition of life, the more vigilant and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full he will be to take heed of all ſpirituall danger: and on the contrary, the more liberty men doe giue to their affections, and the more they are drunken and ouercome either with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, honours and pleaſures, on the one ſide; or with cares, feares, and ſorrowes on the other ſide, the more ſleepy alſo they are in their minds, and the ſooner ouertaken with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. This watchfulneſſe is according to the former ſobriety, viz chiefly of the inward man. As the former ſobriety is of the affections, ſo this watchfulneſſe is of the mind; namely, when that is alway forecaſting of dangers, and ſeriouſly ſtudying and meditating how to ſhun and auoid the ſame. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it is ſaid, that <hi>the wiſe mans eyes are in his head: but the foole walketh in darkneſſe. Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 14. that is, a wiſe man is neuer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, but alwaies carefull and looking about him, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting and auoiding of dangers: but a foole is alwaies in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and continually ouertaken with ſome euill or other, as one that walketh in darkneſſe falleth into this hole or that: or at leaſt ſtumblethat at this and that. That like is in another place, <hi>A prudent man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe, but the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh goe on ſtill and are puniſhed. Pro.</hi> 22. 3. and 27. 12. In theſe places it is to be obſerued, that this watching (whereof now I ſpeake) is commended as a ſpeciall point of wiſedome: and that therefore as it concurreth with the ſobriety of the inward man before ſpoken of, ſo alſo it is not vnfitly here handled with that before ſaid of wiſedome. Doth not this therefore much alſo increaſe the foreſaid dignity of Gods children? ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily it doth: this being conſidered that wicked and naturall men doe daily fall into infinit dangers, as euen now was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by want of this watchfulneſſe.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the true loue of God and of men, only found in the children of God: and ſo of the further dignity of the children of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I haue before ſpoken of ſome particular branches of the life of God and wiſedome, and holineſſe before generally handled; ſo I might likewiſe ſpeake of the reſt: For the very leaſt is of great price, and doth not a little amplifie the dignity of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But ſo to particularize in this place, would be too tedious. I ſhall alſo by other occaſions ſpeake of ſome of them afterward: and ſuch as I ſhall not at all ſpeake of, may be eſteemed by that which I write of the reſt. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that ſuch as I haue not handled, or ſhall not ſpeake of, may be the better conſidered, let me adde ſomething tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the loue of the children of God, towards God and men, as that indeed which comprehendeth all that ſhall be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is alſo the fountaine of all the other particulars of the former life of God, &amp;c. it being the <hi>fulfilling of the law and bond of perfection,</hi> as before we haue heard.</p>
               <p>But of this loue of the children of God towards God and men, I will only ſpeake very briefly, leauing the reſt to the conſideration of the reader.</p>
               <p>Some perhaps may looke that I ſhould haue ſpoken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of before; but ſeeing our freedome from ſinne to ſerue God in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, doth ſo depend (as wee haue heard) vpon wiſedome, (ſuch as be fooles being commonly accounted ſeruants by nature) and ſeeing the ſobriety before handled is of ſo neere kindred (as it were) to the ſaid wiſedome, that it is called (as we haue likewiſe heard) by the ſame name: and ſeeing the foreſaid watchfulneſſe doth alſo ſo depend, (as hath been ſhewed) vpon the ſaid ſobriety, therefore I thought it not amiſſe to handle all the ſaid particulars together, as I haue done.</p>
               <p>To come now to the loue of God and of men, let vs only
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18428:72"/> obſerue this one point, namely, that it is as proper to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God only, as the life of God, wiſedome, freedom from the bondage of ſinne, with liberty to ſerue God in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, the ſobriety and watchfulneſſe before handled. All that are not the children of God, but be wicked and meere naturall men, are as far from all right loue of God and men, as they are deſtitute of the former life of God, of the former wiſedome, and of the other things before ſpoken of. As none haue the life of God, neither are wiſe, neither are freed from ſinne, neither can ſerue God in holineſſe and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life; neither are ſober in the manner before deſcribed, neither can be watchfull for the auoiding of dangers, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the children of God; ſo none can rightly loue God or men but only they.</p>
               <p>Touching the loue of God this is manifeſt, becauſe if we <hi>be the friends of Chriſt, if we doe what ſoeuer be commandeth vs, Ioh.</hi> 15. 14. then it muſt needs follow, that they are the enemies of Chriſt, and conſequently of God, that do not that which is commanded them. If the wicked be Gods enemies, how can they loue him? Againe, theſe words are often confounded in the Pſalmes, viz. <hi>the wicked,</hi> and <hi>the enemies of the Lord. The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhall periſh and the enemies of the Lord ſhall be conſumed as the fat of lambes Pſal. 37. 20. Pſal</hi> 68. 1. the wicked are ſaid <hi>to be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Lord, and hate him:</hi> and againe; <hi>God will wound the bead of his enemies, and the harry pate of him that walketh in his ſinnes:</hi> verſ. 21. So the wicked (according to that ſpoken before of wiſedome) are ſaid to be <hi>fooliſh ones, and the Lords enemies. Pſal.</hi> 74. 18. and 23. So the wicked, (eſpecially that are enemies to the Church) are called <hi>haters of the Lord: Pſal.</hi> 81. 14. 15.

               <p>Laſt of all, we haue heard before, that the wicked doe not know God. Can they loue him, whom they know not? The ſame is to be ſaid of their loue towards men.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18428:73"/> how can they loue them from whom they receiue nothing, or very little, and that only as from the inſtruments of God? and vpon whom they are forced to beſtow ſomthing of their owne, and ſo to be at charge with them? For theſe reaſons and the like, when the Apoſtle in the place before alledged had deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed vs in our naturall ſtate, and being vnregenerated, to be <hi>vnwiſe, diſobedient, deceiued </hi> he addeth further that we were <hi>hatefull, and hating one another: Tit.</hi> 3. 3. So the wicked are both hated of other, and doe alſo hate other: and nothing but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is to be looked for amongſt them.</p>
               <p>This hatred of the wicked againſt God and men, is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teſtimony of that extreme fooliſhneſſe and madneſſe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſpoken of) which is in the heart of the wicked. For what extreme madneſſe is it for mortall men, that are but as the pot in the hand of the potter, to hate the immortall God, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all might and power, is able when he will, to breake them all in pieces like a potters veſſell? What folly alſo is it to hate all other, whereby to make themſelues likewiſe hatefull and odious to all other? Doe not ſuch both waies (as we ſay) much worſe then bring an old houſe vpon their owne heads? They that make themſelues odious to God and men, ſhall certainly ſmart full deeply and wofully in the end.</p>
               <p>If it be obiected touching the loue of God, that <hi>Paul</hi> being but a naturall man, before he knew Chriſt ſo loued God, that he ſpeaketh much of his zeale, and that in his ſaid zeale <hi>his righteouſneſſe of the law</hi> was ſuch, <hi>that he was vnrebukeable. Phil.</hi> 3. 6. and that that ſeemeth to haue been in truth and not in ſhew.</p>
               <p>If any (I ſay) obiect this, I anſwer, that though the aforeſaid zeale, and feruent loue of <hi>Paul</hi> were indeed true, as this word <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>true</hi> may be an attribute of the affections, and is oppoſed to hypocriſie, or to that which is but counterfet and feined, and as it ſignifieth vnfeined and without hypocriſie; yet as the ſame is an attribute of the obiects of the mind, and is oppoſed to erroneous, and ſignifieth right, ſo it cannot be ſaid that the zeale or ſeruent loue of <hi>Paul</hi> was true.</p>
               <p>Though he loued God vnfeinedly and in the truth of his affections from the heart, and ſo was very ſtrict touching the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18428:73"/> outward righteouſneſſe of the law: yet it cannot be ſaid that he loued God truly, that is, rightly; becauſe his mind being not rightly informed, his iudgement therefore touching the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cauſes why, and the manner how God was to be loued, could not but be erroneous. For ſo long as he knew not Chriſt but perſecuted him, and the doctrine, and profeſſors of him, and ſo much leſſe beleeued in him, he wanted that which ſhould haue giuen life to his loue. For, as we haue heard, <hi>Faith worketh by loue: Gal.</hi> 5. 6. and loue muſt come from <hi>faith vnfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. 1. Tim.</hi> 1. 5. The like is to be ſaid of the zeale of God in the Iſraelites, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> beareth them witneſſe: and yet ſaith that it was <hi>not according to knowledge, Rom.</hi> 10. 1. 2. So alſo of the zeale of many other ignorant men: Howſoeuer their loue and their zeale may be ſaid to be true, that is, vnfeined, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hypocriſie, euen in ſimplicity, yet becauſe it is without knowledge, and much more without faith, therefore it cannot be right, and therefore alſo not at all acceptable vnto God. For <hi>without knowledge, the mind</hi> (or heart) <hi>is not good. Pro.</hi> 19. 2. and <hi>without faith it is not poſſible to pleaſe God. Heb.</hi> 11. 6. Yea, <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is not of faith is ſinne. Rom.</hi> 14. 23.</p>
               <p>That which I haue ſaid of this loue towards God in meere naturall men, may be ſaid of the like loue in the like, towards men: For that which condemneth the loue of ſuch towards God how vnfeined ſoeuer, condemneth alſo the loue of ſuch towards men, how earneſt and feruent ſoeuer the ſame bee.</p>
               <p>The loue therefore that is betwixt man and wife, betwixt parents and children, betwixt kindred, and betwixt friends, &amp;c. the parties that doe ſo loue being not regenerate but meerly naturall, cannot be right, as not comming from ſound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith vnfeined, neither being directed by the word, which is the only rule, both of affections, and alſo of actions.</p>
               <p>Againe, the loue of ſuch towards God and men, is moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, and altogether vnconſtant, ſo that to day a friend, and to morrow a mortall enemy. I will not ſtand vpon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples either of ancient or of later times, of ſuch as haue ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at the firſt to haue been very zealous of God, and for God, and yet afterward reuolted (ſuch in old time were <hi>Ioaſh,</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:18428:74"/> 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 24. and <hi>Vzzta. 2.

I will not ſtand vpon theſe examples, but I will chiefly inſiſt vpon the vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and inconſtancy of the loue of natural men towards other.</p>
               <p>Touching this therefore, as <hi>Salomons</hi> words may be (by way of ſimilitude) applied to other things, euen to the vncertainty and ſhortneſſe of the proſperity of the wicked (as afterward alſo we ſhall ſee) ſo they ſeeme chiefly and moſt properly to be vnderſtood of the loue of the wicked (either towards God or towards men, but in that place chiefly towards men) viz. <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>that it is like the cracking of thornes vnder a pot. Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 8. that is, though very great for a time, yet ſuddenly vaniſhed away. This (I ſay) ſeemeth to be the moſt proper and naturall ſenſe and meaning of that place: becauſe <hi>Salomon</hi> hauing ſaid in the verſe next before, <hi>It is better to heare the rebuke of a wiſe man, then that a man ſhould heare the ſong of fooles</hi> (that is, it is better to heare ſome ſharpe words wiſely by wiſe men ſpoken in the iuſt reproofe of ſinne, then the ſoothing and faire words of fooliſh men, what proteſtation ſoeuer they make of their loue, and whatſoeuer their loue be for the preſent) <hi>Salomon</hi> I ſay, hauing ſo ſaid, immediatly inferreth the former words as a reaſon and confirmation of theſe, and ſaith, <hi>For like the noiſe of the thornes vnder the pot, ſo is the laughter of a foole;</hi> meaning by laughter that which before he had meant by the word ſong: and by the word <hi>ſong</hi> vnderſtanding the ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant words, whereby the wicked doe flatter and ſooth vp o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any ſinne, as likewiſe their actuall teſtimonies, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deeds of kindneſſe ſhewed by them, for the better incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of other to ſuch euill as themſelues doe approoue. Of ſuch loue <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, that it is <hi>but as the cracking</hi> or <hi>rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of thornes vnder a pot:</hi> though vehement, hot and feruent for a time, yet by and by euen vpon nothing, or at leaſt vpon trifling reaſons (though ſometime alſo vpon good ground) quailed, cooled, and brought to nothing: ſometime alſo tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into extreme hatred. Hereof there are many examples. At
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18428:74"/> 
                  <hi>Iakobs</hi> firſt comming to <hi>Padan Aram</hi> to his vnkle <hi>Laban,</hi> how kindly and louingly was he entertained by <hi>Laban:</hi> what great ſignes did he ſhew, and what great profeſſion did he make of loue? As ſoone as he heard he was come, he tarried not till he came to his houſe, but <hi>he ran out to meet him.</hi> What more? <hi>he embraced him.</hi> What more? <hi>he kiſſed him.</hi> What more? <hi>he brought him to his houſe.</hi> What more? <hi>he ſaid vnto him, Thou art my bone and my fleſh.</hi> What more? <hi>he abode with him the ſpace of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</hi> What more? He ſaid further vnto him, <hi>Though thou be my brother ſhouldſt thou ſerue me for nothing? Tell me what ſhall be thy wages?</hi> What more? At his firſt asking he gaue him his daughter: yea, but not the right, but <hi>Leah</hi> for <hi>Rahel.</hi> Yea, but preſently he gaue him <hi>Rahel</hi> alſo. <hi>Gen. 29. 13, &amp;c.</hi> Here were great matters; who would not haue thought there had been great loue; and ſuch as much water would not haue quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched? Notwithſtanding how his heart was afterward changed, how his countenance was eſtranged, and how many waies he delt hardly with him, and worſe would haue dealt, if God had not appeared vnto him, and commanded him to doe nothing but good to <hi>Iakob,</hi> we know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> at the firſt is ſaid <hi>to haue loued Dauid exceedingly: 1. Sam.</hi> 16. 22. yet afterward when <hi>Dauid</hi> had much more deſerued his loue, he hated him as extreamly; yea, his own ſonne <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> alſo for his ſake: 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 30. Yea, he ſo hated all the Lords prieſts for his ſake, that for the ſuppoſed fault of one, he commanded them all to be ſlaine. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 18. yea, though he did afterward with teares relent vnto <hi>Dauid, acknowledging him more righteous then himſelfe: 1. Sam.</hi> 24. 17. and ſo making a great ſhew of renuing his firſt loue, yet preſently againe he perſecuted him as eagerly as before. The like may be ſaid of the loue of the ſaid <hi>Saul</hi> towards his owne Sonne <hi>Ionathan,</hi> to whom he was bound by nature: but of this before. <hi>Iehoram</hi> King of Iſrael one while could call <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet by the name of his father: 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 21. againſt whom notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuch (immediatly almoſt) was his indignation, and fury, that he ſaid, <hi>God doe ſo, and more alſo to me. If the head of Eliſha the ſonne of Shephat, ſhall ſtand on him this day.</hi> verſ. 31. To day <hi>Herod</hi> could ſo <hi>reuerence Iohn Baptiſt, that he heard him gladly,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18428:75"/> and did many things, &amp;c.</hi> yet the next day he beheaded him, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the requeſt of an whoriſh, and wanton damſell. <hi>Mark. 6. 20. &amp;c? Demas</hi> one while was the familiar friend of <hi>Paul, Coloſ. 4. 14. Philem.</hi> 24. but not long after he forſooke him, and made more account of <hi>this preſent world,</hi> that is, both of the things, and alſo of men of this world: 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. What alſo may be ſaid of the great fauour of <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> towards <hi>Haman,</hi> to whom he did not only command <hi>that all his ſeruants ſhould bow their knees, Eſter.</hi> 3. 2. but who alſo was all in all with him, ſo that he obtained of him letters written in his own name, and ſealed with his own ſeale for the deſtroying of all the Iewes in one day? Notwithſtanding this great grace did not only die ſuddenly, and with ſpeaking of one word, but it was turned alſo into ſuch vnreconciliable indignation, that <hi>Haman</hi> was hanged in a moment, vpon the ſame gallowes which he had prepared for <hi>Mordecas. Eſter</hi> 7. 9. 10. So may all <hi>Hamans,</hi> euen ſuch enemies of the Lord and of the Lords people, be diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and periſh in the end, that do not (as <hi>Paul</hi> did before his calling) belong vnto the Lord.</p>
               <p>The like we ſee by daily experience: For be the loue of the wicked either towards the children of God, or towards them of their own crue and ſort, neuer ſo great, neuer ſo hot, neuer ſo burning, yet euery trifle putteth all cleane out: and for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry toy they are ready to fall out with their ancienteſt, and the beſt friends they haue: and oft times they become as bitter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as euer before they were feruent friends. Sometimes they fall out in play: ſomtimes vpon the falſe reports of tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers: ſomtimes for a matter of profit, though perhaps not of a penny value: ſomtimes for an vnkind word: ſomtimes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on meer ſuſpition: ſomtimes vpon miſtaking either of ſome ſpeeches, or ſome actions: and ſomtimes vpon other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But why is the loue of the wicked ſo variable, ſo mutable, and ſo eaſily alienated from them towards whom it is? Euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not wel rooted &amp; grounded; neither are they wel roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; grounded in it. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 18. They loue for profit, or for pleaſure, or for ſome other carnall reſpect. Their loue is of the fleſh, not of the ſpirit. The knot thereof is not made by thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſpirit of God, therfore it is eaſily diſſolued; As a ſtake
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18428:75"/> ſtuck into the earth &amp; not rooted, is eaſily plucked vp: As an houſe without ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill and good vnderpinning, eſpecially ſtanding bleakly, ſubiect to the winds, &amp; hauing no defence of trees, of other buildings, or of hills, is quickly ouerthrown: ſo is the loue of the wicked ſtraight quailed, and with euery little blaſt quite blown ouer. This eſpecially may be ſaid of the loue of the wicked towards the children of God. For although ſuch loue on Gods part be not without his ſpeciall prouidence; yea and oft times wrought by his ſpeciall power of his ſpeciall goodneſſe: yet on the wickeds part, it is for the moſt part not grounded vpon the godlineſſe, or goodneſſe of ſuch as they loue, but vpon ſome ſpeciall reſpect vnto themſelues. So <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphar</hi> loued <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> becauſe he was a good ſteward for him, and the Lord bleſſed him in that which he took in hand: yea, all things that <hi>Potiphar</hi> had for his ſake. So <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did afterward loue &amp; grace the ſame <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> becauſe he had well interpreted his dreames: and had giuen good counſell againſt the time of dearth, ſignified by one part of the ſaid dreames. So <hi>Saul</hi> loued <hi>Dauid</hi> for his skill vpon the harpe: the ſame may be ſaid of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Thus then we ſee what the loue of the wicked, and of meer naturall men is: and thereby how vile and baſe their ſtate and condition is. For what a dogged nature is it to loue no longer then they ſee benefit towards them, and ſo to loue one while, that preſently they hate; and oft times do hate more then they did loue? as <hi>Ammons</hi> hatred is ſaid to haue been more againſt <hi>Tamar</hi> then his loue had been towards her. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 15. Dogs loue in this manner: for let their maſters that doe alwaies feed them, but vnawares tread a little vpon their foot, and they will be ready to bite them by the leg, if not to ſlie in their face.</p>
               <p>It is far otherwiſe with the children of God. For ſo many as <hi>are new borne, not of mortall, but of immortall ſeede by the word of God, hauing purified their ſoules in obeying the truth, to loue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly without feining, doe accordingly loue with a pure heart fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently: 1. Pe.</hi> 1. 23. Now although that place be vnderſtood ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of brotherly loue, yet he that loueth them that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, will much more loue him that hath begotten.</p>
               <p>And indeed how can the children of God but loue him,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18428:76"/> whom they know by his word to be ſo mighty, ſo infinit, ſo wiſe, ſo iuſt, and euery way ſo good in himſelfe: and ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo louing, and ſo mercifull towards them whom he hath ſo loued as to make them his children, in ſuch manner as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto we haue heard, and ſhall further heare.</p>
               <p>As touching the loue of the children of God towards men, eſpecially towards ſuch as are the children of God with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, how can they but loue them that are his creatures, and the workmanſhip of his hands, yea, and which doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble their heauenly father, and their eldeſt brother, and that are ſtamped with the ſame ſpirit, wherewith themſelues are ſtamped; that are heires likewiſe of the ſame inheritance; and for the loue of whom there be ſo many precepts to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, ſo many ſentences to commend it: ſo many promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to prouoke it: ſo many examples to encourage vnto it?</p>
               <p>In all theſe reſpects, the ſaid loue is very excellent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; the more becauſe it doth not only come from God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: but alſo becauſe that thereby we know <hi>that wee are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from death to life, and that we are of the truth, and ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him aſſure our hearts. 1. Ioh.</hi> 3. 14. The Apoſtle ſaith not <hi>that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>thereby we are tranſlated, and that thereby we are aſſured,</hi> but only <hi>that we know our ſelues ſo to be.</hi> So then this loue is a ſpeciall part of the euidence of our ſaluation, and of our comfortable appearance before him both in this life, and alſo in the life to come, euen in the great day when all fleſh ſhall be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and when the books of all mens actions known and ſecret, ſhall be opened before him. That which the Apoſtle in the former Chapter verſ. 29. had aſcribed to the whole worke of regeneration, is in the places before alledged, aſcribed to this one point thereof, viz. our vnfeined loue towards other the children of God: becauſe indeed all other things are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without it. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1. 2. and where that is, there are all other graces, either as cauſes working it, and by it, or as effects and fruits thereof, comming from it: and therefore (as before we haue heard) it is called <hi>the fulfilling of the law; and the bond of perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Sauiour alſo ſaith that vpon theſe two commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18428:76"/> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy ſoule, with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy minde: and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe, hangeth the whole law and the Prophets. Mat.</hi> 22. 40 So that theſe two points, either as they are to be performed by vs, or as they <note place="margin">Note.</note> be performed for vs by our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, are the text (as it were) of all the reſt of the word of God: which is ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that when <hi>Dauid</hi> had learned much thereof, yet he prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lord <hi>to open his eyes that he might ſee the wonders of his law. Pſal.</hi> 119. 18. thereby nothing that <hi>the wonders of the law of God which he did ſee,</hi> he accounted in a manner as nothing, in reſpect of thoſe which he did deſire further to behold. So alſo in further commendation of the excellency of the ſaid law, he ſaith againe, <hi>Thy teſtimonies are wonderfull: therefore doth my ſoule keepe them.</hi> verſ. 129. If therefore the word of God be ſo excellent, is not that alſo excellent, that is the chiefe ſubiect matter thereof and whereunto all that is contained in the word, ſome way or other may well be referred?</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, although this loue be ſo excellent, yet it is not (as the papiſts blurt it out, and ſtoutly defend it) <hi>the forme of faith.</hi> For then ſhould it be a part of faith; yea, the chiefe part of faith, and that part without which faith ſhould haue no being at all, becauſe the forme doth giue being to that which is formed, and ſo it ſhould be no otherwiſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from faith then as a part of faith it ſelfe, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly repugnant to that place, which they eſpecially plead for the magnifying of loue: <hi>And now abideth faith, hope, and loue, theſe three. 1. Cor.</hi> 13. 13. For in this place we ſee the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle as plainly to diſtinguiſh loue from faith, as he doth diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh hope: and to make theſe to be three. How could this be, if loue were a part of faith? and if faith were no faith without loue? Indeed there is no faith without loue; but if therefore we ſhould make loue to be the principall part of faith, we ſhould make many a mad concluſion.</p>
               <p>Againe, loue by the doctrine of the Papiſts, vpon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place, is better then faith. Can a part be better then the whole? Then it ſhould be better then it ſelfe with addition of another good thereunto.</p>
               <p>Loue alſo is an effect of faith, as before we heard out of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18428:77"/> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. therefore it cannot be the forme of faith. Laſt of al, by faith we meane faith in Ieſus Chriſt, and euery mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing of the particular forgiueneſſe of his own ſinnes, and of his own particular ſaluation by Ieſus Chriſt. The loue that is required of vs, was in <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, in whom there was no ſuch faith.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the excellency of the loue before ſpoken of: as we haue heard the loue of the wicked to be very varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſoone quenched, yea, turned oft times into extreme hatred, ſo the loue of the children of God is moſt conſtant, and abideth to the end. <hi>Loue doth neuer fall away, though that prophecying be aboliſhed, or the tongues ceaſe, or knowledge vaniſh away. 1. Cor.</hi> 13. 8. The loue of the children of God being <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere without diſſimulation, Rom.</hi> 12. 9. well rooted and grounded, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 18. vpon the word, and in Chriſt Ieſus, it is conſtant without wearineſſe, either in affection, or in action: <hi>Gal.</hi> 6 9. As <hi>God loueth to the end, whomſoeuer he loueth, Ioh.</hi> 13. 1. ſo his children walke in the ſteps of the ſame loue: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 1. 2. To conclude this point, the more excellent this loue is (a ſpeciall point wherein conſiſteth the matter of our regeneration) the more excellent alſo is the eſtate and condition of all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God ſo regenerated, in whom alone it is to be found.</p>
               <p>The ſilly Cock doth ſometimes find an earthly pearle of great price in an earthly dunghill: and a foole may as ſoone as a wiſe man find a great iewell in the mire of the ſtreet: but this heauenly pearle and iewell of loue, whereby we doe moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble God, and ſhew our ſelues to <hi>be borne of him, 1. Ioh.</hi> 4. 7. and <hi>whereby all men doe know vs to be the diſciples of Christ, Ioh.</hi> 13. 35. This (I ſay) is not to be found in the dunghill and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart of naturall and vnregenerate men, that are only <hi>of the earth earthly:</hi> It is only to be found in the children of God, that <hi>are borne from aboue,</hi> and by their regeneration are from <hi>heauen heauenly,</hi> as he is into whom they are incorporated; whoſe <hi>hearts are ſanctified by the word, Ioh.</hi> 17. 17. <hi>and purified by faith, Acts</hi> 15. 9. as before we haue heard. Thus much of the loue of God and men, peculiar only to the children of God: and ſo conſequently of the further dignity of the ſaid chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God thereby.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus we haue heard of the precious free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Gods children, in that they are not only diſcharged from the ſeruitude of ſinne, but are alſo made the ſeruants of God, and may ſerue <hi>him in holineſſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe:</hi> from whence it commeth, that they are ſober, watchfull, and louing, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we haue heard.</p>
               <p>There remaineth yet a further degree of the ſaid liberty and freedome of Gods children, as one ſpecial part (as it were) of the matter of their new birth: and as one ſpeciall point, wherein as well as in other things conſiſteth their being as they are the children of God.</p>
               <p>This is, that beſides that before mentioned, they are alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchized and made free of a moſt excellent, of a rich, and of a glorious city: euen of the heauenly Ieruſalem, wherof many glorious things are ſpoken, in many places of the ſcripture (as the Prophet ſpeaketh of the old Ieruſalem in the ſame reſpect viz. as it was the Church of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. 3.) eſpecially in the 21. Chapter of the Reuelation: where it is moſt excellently and diuinely deſcribed, not only, as it is in heauen with God, and in the preſence of God, and of his holy Angels; but alſo as yet it is and ſhall be vpon earth. Of this excellent and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous city are all the chilldren of God made free, beeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from their naturall ſeruitude, and bondage vnto ſinne.</p>
               <p>This freedom of the new Ieruſalem ſeemeth to be noted by the Apoſtle to the Hebrews, where after the oppoſition of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and diuers things whereunto they were not come, as <hi>vnto the mount that might not be touched, to the burning fire, to black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and darkneſſe, and tempeſt, and the ſound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, &amp;c.</hi> (by all which hee meaneth their deliuerance from the Lawe which conſiſted in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not in the ſpirit) then hee addeth, <hi>that they were
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18428:78"/> come vnto the mount Sion, and to the city of the liuing God, the celeſtiall Ieruſalem, and to the company of innumerable Angels, and to the aſſembly and congregation of the new borne, which are written in heauen, and to God the iudge of all, and to the ſpirits of iuſt and perfect men, and to Ieſus the Mediator of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to the bloud of ſprinkling, which ſpeaketh better things then that of Abel. Heb. 12. 22. &amp;c.</hi> This is a moſt pregnant and noble teſtimony, not only ſetting forth the excellency of that City whereof all the children of God are made free; but many other points alſo before more largely handled.</p>
               <p>To ſpeake yet a little more of this freedom: As apprentices that ſerue in Cities (in <hi>London, Canterbury, Yorke, Norwich</hi> and other) when they haue ſerued a certaine time, according to the cuſtome and order of ſuch Cities or other townes corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, then they are not only releaſed from their ſeruice, but they are alſo themſelues made free of the Cities, and do enioy diuers priuileges and benefits belonging to ſuch Cities: ſo they that are releaſed from the bondage of ſinne and ſatan, are made free alſo of the heauenly Ieruſalem before ſpoken of; and do enioy the priuiledges and benefits thereof: ſuch as do not belong to any forrainers, but are proper only to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and to thoſe that are diſcharged of their maſters, whom by nature they ſerued. Yet here this difference is not to be forgotten betwixt the priuileges of this heauenly City, and the priuileges of all earthly cities. For the priuileges of earthly cities are intended towards ſuch as haue ſerued their times in ſome trade or other, as rewards of their ſaid ſeruice, ſuppoſed faithfully to haue been performed by ſuch ſeruants: but the priuileges of the heauenly city now ſpoken of are no rewards of our ſeruice to ſinne and ſatan, (for the reward or wages thereof is nothing but death. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.) but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits belonging to the children of God, only of Gods free grace and goodneſſe: yet the more to comfort them againſt their former hard ſeruice of ſinne, and againſt the daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of ſinne in them, and the manifold ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18428:78"/> and therefore alſo the greater benefit is the freedome thereof.</p>
               <p>The freedome of <hi>Rome</hi> was wont to be ſo highly eſteemed, <note place="margin">Note.</note> that <hi>Claudius Lyſias</hi> a chiefe captaine for the Romans at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, acknowledged that freedome to haue coſt him a great ſumme. <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 28. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo himſelfe being free borne of that city, pleadeth his ſaid freedome in that behalfe againſt thoſe iniuries that were offered vnto him, verſ. 25. and ſo by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof he found the more fauor, at leaſt they feared the more to wrong him, as they had done.</p>
               <p>The freedom of many Cities in this land (eſpecially of London, and of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inque ports in <hi>Kent)</hi> is ſuch, that many great men are content, both that their ſonnes (being of good yeers and growth) ſhall ſerue ſeuen, eight, or nine yeeres: yea, and to giue likewiſe good ſummes of mony right out with them, that they may haue the benefit of the freedome after their time expired; and alſo to procure the ſaid freedome for themſelues in diuers reſpects.</p>
               <p>What then is the freedome of this heauenly Ieruſalem, whereof now we ſpeake, and for which Chriſt hath giuen a greater price, then all the cities in the world, yea, then ten thouſand ſuch worlds are worth? Truly it is this, that whereas we are here <hi>pilgrims and ſtrangers, 1. Pet.</hi> 2. 11. yet beeing free of the heauenly Ieruſalem, <hi>wee haue our conuerſation in heauen. Philip.</hi> 3. 20. that is, that we behaue our ſelues as citizens of heauen, liue according to the lawes which we haue from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and do that which we doe as cheerfully and willingly as the Angels in heauen. Is this all? No: we haue liberty alſo to trade for heauenly wares, yea, neceſſity lieth vpon vs, and we are bound, and as it were by our baptiſme (the ſeale of Gods couenant) ſworne ſo to doe at our enrolment: yea, daily wee may, and we ought to trade euen for heauen it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>As many free of London, by vertue of their ſaid freedome do trade in other countries for ſuch commodities as will be moſt vendible in London, and for the moſt benefit either of Londoners themſelues, or of ſuch as reſort to London: ſo is it with all the children of God, that being releaſed from their ſeruice of ſinne, are made free men of heauen. For by this their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18428:79"/> freedome, they may trade, and do trade for heauen, and for the daily increaſe of that heauenly ſtock, which in their rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration their heauenly father doth giue them to occupy withall, and wherwith (as it were) to begin the new world: euen the world to come, whiles they liue as ſtrangers in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world.</p>
               <p>From heauen, <hi>and from the father of lights in heauen, commeth euery good and perfect gift. Iames</hi> 1. 17. And this <hi>father of lights,</hi> being ſole and abſolute gouernour of heauen and earth, will not admit any to trade for any merchandiſe of his chiefe city (heauen) but only ſuch as can (as it were) ſhew by their Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that they are freed from their ſeruice, and that they had their names alſo enrolled in heauen book. If they can ſhew this they ſhall be ſuffered to trade for any merchandiſe of the city: yea, they ſhall be ſure, neuer to be bankrupts: but that they ſhall gaine well for themſelues and their, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 37. but of this afterward.</p>
               <p>This freedome is ſuch, that there is none ſo poore but may occupy frankly: for he may haue the beſt commodities of the city, freely and for nothing. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55. 1.</p>
               <p>This freedome is the greater becauſe the commodities of that city, are better then all other, and no where elſe to be had. According to the worth of any commodities of any country, ſo is the freedome for trading to ſuch countries eſteemed: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, if ſuch commodities be not to be found in other countries.</p>
               <p>This freedome is ſuch, that as free men of London haue certaine priuileges, as well out of London, as in London, euen whereſoeuer they dwell: ſo likewiſe haue all that are free of heauen, whatſoeuer part of the earth they do inhabit.</p>
               <p>By this freedome all partaker thereof haue this ſingular benefit, (be they neuer ſo poore) that if any man (how mighty ſoeuer) do them any wrong, eſpecially by infringing their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties any way, they may haue their action againſt him in the Court of heauen: where they ſhall haue a good aduocate <hi>Chriſt Ieſus the righteous, 1.

This hope agreeth with faith, in that it hath the ſame author, is wrought and increaſed by the ſame meanes, is in the ſame ſubiect, and continueth the ſame time: but herein it differeth, that the obiect of faith is the whole word of God: but the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of hope is only the promiſes in the word.

So all the good, promiſed hereafter to be performed, is beleeued by faith, and expected or looked for by hope. Euery truth therfore of God reuealed in his word written, is the obiect of faith: (For by faith we beleeue the word touching the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world by the word: <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 3.) but hope hath only relation to the promiſes of God. Therefore the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the Hebrews <hi>to keepe the profesſion of their hope without wauering.</hi> confirmeth the ſame <hi>by the faithfulneſſe of him that hath promiſed. Heb.</hi> 10. 23. So he reſtraineth hope, only to the promiſes of God.</p>
               <p>As by faith we beleeue as well the promiſes of this life, as of the life to come; and therefore <hi>the iuſt man doth liue by his faith,</hi> as well touching this life, as touching the life to come: ſo by hope we doe expect or looke for the performance as well of the promiſes of this life, as of the life to come.

               <p>This hope is as proper to the children of God as faith it ſelfe; becauſe it is an handmaid only of faith: looking only for the performance of thoſe things, which faith beleeueth ſhall be performed.

In like manner, their hope may be much quailed, and ſhaken, and obſeured. For faith
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18428:82"/> being wounded, hope cannot be found; becauſe it dependeth vpon faith. But neither faith nor hope can be altogether and vtterly ouerwhelmed.</p>
               <p>This then is a moſt ſingular priuiledge and comfort. And hereby the children of God, in great afflictions of this life, in common death and famine, in ſpeciall want and penurie, in ſicknes, in priſon, in baniſhment, in the hatred and malice of many and mightie aduerſaries, in croſſes abroad, and in croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at home: as alſo in great aſſaults of Satan, in great accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their owne conſcience, in remembrance of their great and manifold ſinnes ſet before them by Satan in all their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and amplified and aggrauated by all the circumſtances that may be: by this hope (I ſay) the children of God in all theſe are moſt cheerefull and comfortable (as <hi>Paul</hi> was 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8. &amp;c.) when the wicked hang downe their heads, are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with cares, feares, and griefes, and doe vtterly deſpaire, and be alſo vncapable of all comfort. But of theſe things ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hath beene ſaid before, and more ſhall be afterward.</p>
               <p>Now all before ſaid of our life, knowledge, wiſedome, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and righteouſnes generally, as alſo more particularly of our ſobrietie, watchfulnes, loue and hope, is not ſo to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode as if the ſaid things were in like meaſure in all the children of God. For all haue not the like outward meanes, whereby to atteine vnto them: neither the like time &amp;c.

For although euery one that layeth hold of Chriſt, layeth not hold of a peece of Chriſt, but of whole Chriſt ſpiritually touching his eſſence, yet it is not ſo touching his efficacy. So then the more faith any man hath, the more he layeth hold of Chriſt (in maner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid) and conſequently he receiueth the more life, the more wiſedom, the more ſanctification generally, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the more ſobriety loue and hope.</p>

Our <hi>life, knowledge, wiſedom, &amp;c.</hi> doe admit <hi>plus &amp; minus, more and leſſe:</hi> But our iuſtification doth not ſo: No man is iuſtified in part before God, except he be iuſtified perfectly, and altogether. If a man could be iuſtified and diſcharged of all his ſinnes, but only of one, and that one the leaſt of all otehr, yet that one were ſufficient to the eternall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation of that party, notwithſtanding his iuſtification, and diſcharge from all the reſt. The worke alſo of our iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is but one worke, wrought all at once, not by degrees. But though our regeneration be ſo likewiſe, I meane of the whole man together (not firſt of one part then of another:) &amp; though alſo in our regeneration, our ſanctification be likewiſe begun, yet our ſanctification is not perfected all at once, but by degrees it is more &amp; more encreaſed.

As therefore a man is but once naturally borne, not by degrees but all together, and the new borne babe as ſoone as eure he is out of the mothers wombe, is as perfectly borne as he that is 20. or 40. yeeres old; but being new borne he is not preſently of his perfect ſtature, but commeth &amp; groweth to that by degrees in time, by meate, &amp; drinke, and other meanes fit for the ſame: ſo is it touching our regeneration &amp; ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctification: we are new borne all at once, euen the firſt day we receiue by the word the ſpirit of adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but though the alſo we begin to be ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified, yet we grow more &amp; more therin afterward, as the new born babe doth in ſtature.</p>

               <p>By this image of God ſo renewed, and daily increaſed in all the new borne children of God, the pooreſt and meaneſt of the ſaid children of God, how deformed ſoeuer they be in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (bleare-eied, or ſquint-eyed, crook-necked, crook-backed, or crook-handed or legged, or hauing any other bodily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity) are notwithſtanding more truly beautifull, then euer was <hi>Abſolom,</hi> though <hi>In all Iſrael, there was none ſo much to be praiſed for beauty as Abſalom becauſe that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſole of the foot euen to the top of his head there was no blemiſh in him. 2.

               <p>As before touching the life of God, we compared meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall men to images, applying that vnto them that <hi>Habbakuk</hi> ſpeaketh of images, that although <hi>they were laid ouer with gold and ſiluer, yet they had no breath in them:</hi> ſo now alſo all thoſe things whereby images be deſcribed. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. may likewiſe be ſpoken of meer natural men, and of all wicked men whatſoeuer: <hi>They haue a mouth and ſpeake not, they haue eyes and ſee not, they haue eares and heare not: they haue noſes and ſmell not, they haue hands and handle not: they haue feet and walke not: neither make they a ſound with their throat.</hi> Theſe things (I ſay) wherby images are thus deſcribed, may alſo be applied to all meer naturall men.

To paſſe therfore from the form, and not to be curious in diſtinguiſhing therof from the matter, let vs come to the end why God hath ſo loued vs, as to make, or to call, or to declare vs to be his children.</p>
               <p>This is noted and expreſſed, to be <hi>the praiſe and glorie of his grace: Epheſ.</hi> 1. 6.

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may be now expected, that I ſhould in the next place ſpeake of the effects of the children of God: but I will not bee curious in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing effects from benefits, or commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging vnto them. I grant that by the exact rules of art, benefits properly are to be accounted adiuncts, or appurtenances and things belonging to another. But herein I will not be curious: but rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauor to be plaine, and therefore to write for the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſimpleſt, then for the pleaſing of ſuch as reſpect method more then matter. That which is plaine and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous may be vnderſtood of all: but that which is curious &amp; exact altogether according to the rules of art, is moſt for the capacitie onely of them that are acquainted with artes. Some effects of a thing are not to be denied to be alſo benefits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; or at leaſt beneficiall thereunto: albeit that all benefits cannot aptly be called effects, as afterward we ſhall ſee in this matter of our adoption. For euery benefit belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto neither aptly or truely can bee called an effect thereof. Iuſtification is a benefit belonging to adoption: yet adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is rather and effect or thereof, then that a fruit or effect of adoption. Peace of conſcience alſo another benefit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, is both a benefit and alſo a fruit ariſing from adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as afterward ſhall appeare. The like may be ſaid of other things. For this cauſe I will be bold to confound fruits or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects with benefits and commodities of the children of God. Now becauſe all, both effects and fruits, and alſo benefits and commodities of regeneration depend vpon the communion of the new borne children of God with Chriſt Ieſus, therefore although I haue before ſpoken ſomewhat of their ſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion (Chriſt Ieſus being ſhewed to bee the chiefe matter
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18428:88"/> wherein their new birth and being the children of God doth conſiſt, and all other points thereof before handled beeing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the former) yet I will now returne againe thereunto, and lay the ſame more largely forth then before I haue done.</p>
               <p>Touching therfore this communion, that we may yet better ſee what other benefits the children of God haue, and what fruits they bring forth thereby, let vs further vnderſtand, that it is in the Scriptures expreſſed by diuers moſt ſignificant me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors, and excellent ſimilitudes.</p>
               <p>For firſt, it is compared to the communion betwixt our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and our garments, in which reſpect we are bid to <hi>put on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt: Rom.</hi> 13. 14. Secondly it is compared to the communion betwixt vs and our daily meate and drinke. In which reſpect Chriſt calleth himſelfe <hi>the meat that abideth to eternall life: Ioh. 6. 27. and the bread of God which came downe from heauen,</hi> verſe 33. and <hi>the liuing bread, which whoſoeuer eateth ſhall liue for euer:</hi> and alſo ſaith <hi>that his fleſh is bread, &amp;c.</hi> verſe 51. and that <hi>except we eate his fleſh and drinke his blood, we haue no life in vs,</hi> verſe 53. becauſe <hi>his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood is drinke indeed.</hi> And that <hi>he that eateth his fleſh and drinketh his blood dwelleth in him, and he in him:</hi> verſe 55.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is compared to the communion betwixt the vine and the branches. In which reſpect Chriſt calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>the vine,</hi> and vs <hi>the branches: Ioh.</hi> 15. 5. and <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly ſaith <hi>that we are branches &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 11. 17.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is compared to the communion betwixt the chiefe corner ſtone, and the reſt of the building: <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 42. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it is compared to the communion betwixt a man and the houſe wherein he dwelleth. In which reſoect Chriſt ſaid before, that he <hi>dwelleth in them that eate his fleſh and drinke his blood:</hi> ſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith (as before alſo hath beene ſhewed) that <hi>Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts: Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, it is compared to the communion betwixt the head and the members. For <hi>he</hi> is ſaid <hi>to be the head of his Church,</hi> and the Church is ſaid <hi>to be his body: Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20. and wee are called <hi>his members: Epheſ.</hi> 5. 30.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:18428:88"/>
               <p>Seuenthly, it is compared to the communion betwixt the man and the wife in marriage. Therefore he is often called the husband, and the Church is often called his ſpouſe. And that which the Lord ſaith and promiſeth of marrying the Iſraelites <hi>vnto himſefe for euer in righteouſnes, in indgement, in mercy, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and in faith fulnes, &amp;c. Hoſea</hi> 2. 19. 20. is to be vnderſtood as of all other the elect as well as of Iſrael, on the one part: ſo alſo of the ſecond perſon in the <hi>Deity</hi> (to be, after that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, incarnate and made man) on the other part. For it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vnderſtood of the father or of the holy ghoſt, becauſe they were neuer to aſſume our nature, whereby to be a fit huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band for vs. Therefore alſo as the man and the wife, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marriage (or at leaſt before contract) two, are after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and contract called <hi>one fleſh. Gen.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 5. 6. ſo the Apoſtle vſing the ſame ſimilitude of Chriſt and vs, ſaith, <hi>wee are of his fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſh and of his bones: Epheſ.</hi> 5. 30.</p>
               <p>To ſhut vp this point, ſuch is the communion betwixt Chriſt and the children of God, that the Apoſtle doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly account them compleat in him: <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 10. but ſaith alſo that <hi>they are the fulnes of him that filleth all in all things: Epheſ.</hi> 1. 23. and ſo he inſinuateth generally, that Chriſt is in ſome ſort vnperfect without the children of God, as the husband is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect without the wife: the head without the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: a man without an houſe: the reſt of the building with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the chiefe corner ſtone: the vine without the branches; the meate and drinke without ſome to receiue them: and the garments without ſome to weare the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now to returne to the former metaphors and ſimilitudes, ſo many as the communion betwixt Chriſt the naturall ſonne of God, and vs the adopted children of God is in Scripture expreſſed by: by ſo many waies is our dignity by thi commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion amplified and encreaſed.</p>
               <p>For touching the firſt, was it not a great honour for <hi>Daniel</hi> (as the commandement of <hi>Belſhazzar) to be clothed with purple, and to haue a chaine of gold put about his necke? Dan.</hi> 5. 29. Was it not more, for poore <hi>Mordecay</hi> before appointed to the ſword, and who had before and who had before ſit at the gate of <hi>Ahaſhue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſh

How honourable then is it for ſuch beggerly perſons as we were (that were not onely ſtarke naked, and vtterly without any good apparell, but that alſo were clothed before with moſt polluted garments of all ſinne, &amp;c.) to be clothed with ſo rich a garment as Chriſt Ieſus is? Verily neither <hi>Herod</hi> himſelfe when hee clothed himſelfe <hi>In his royall apparell, Acts</hi> 12. 21. not all the Princes in the world (that had not Chriſt Ieſus) were euer ſo glorious in apparell, as the pooreſt child of God is that <hi>hath put on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> It was an honourable thing to the Iſraelites, that the Lord <hi>led them ſo through the wildernes, that for forty yeeres their clothes waxed not old vpon them, &amp;c. Deuteronomie</hi> 29. 5. How honourable a thing then is it, for all the children of God (both yong and old, great and ſmall) to be clothed with that garment, which as it is called <hi>the new man,</hi> ſo it will alwaies <hi>bee new,</hi> neuer worne, neuer threed-bare, or waxing old, but remaining as freſh for euer as it was the firſt day, euen <hi>the ſame ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdaie, to day and for euer? Hebrewes</hi> 13. 8. for euer, (I ſay) not onely in this world, but alſo in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſecond Metaphor, was it not an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thing for the brethren of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> at their ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into Egypt, to dine with <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and <hi>to haue meates ſet before them from Ioſephs owne table? Geneſis</hi> 43. 16. and 34. So alſo for <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> (though <hi>Ionathans</hi> owne ſonne, and therefore of the blood roiall of <hi>Saul)</hi> to be fed with meate from <hi>Dauids</hi> owne table, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Was it not a great honour alſo for the Iſraelites to be miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly fed in the wildernes with Manna from heauen (which is therefore called angels foode) and with quailes, and with water out of the rocke? How honourable then is it for the pooreſt children of God, to eate of Chriſts owne fleſh, and to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18428:89"/> drinke Chriſts owne blood? Verily, neither the meate of <hi>Dauid,</hi> nor the dainty fare vpon <hi>Salomons</hi> table, in his greateſt glory, nor the dointieſt fare of any other Princes in the world in their greateſt ſolemnities, nor the Manna and quailes, and water out of the rocke before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be giuen to the Iſraelites, was euer comparable in any reſpect, to this diet of the meaneſt ſonnes and daughters of God.</p>
               <p>Touching the third former metaphor, what a ſtrange thing is it, that ſuch ſiences, as we were (though indeede com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to wilde oliue branches, yet ten times worſe) ſhould be grafted into ſo precious and pleaſant a ſtocke as Chriſt is; and thereby bring forth fruits agreeable to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 5. <hi>Philippians</hi> 1. 11. Though in our grafting <note place="margin">Iouis omnia plena.</note> the ſiences which we graft bee nouriſhed by the vertue of that ſtocke, whereinto they are grafted, yet they bring forth fruit according to their owne nature, not according to the nature of the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Touching the fourth former metaphor, how great a grace is it for vs, that were ſo rough, and vnhewen ſtones as we were, to be hewen ſmooth, and made fit to bee coupled to ſuch a precious corner ſtone as Chriſt is?</p>
               <p>The ſame is much more to be vnderſtood of the dignitie of Gods children in reſpect of the firſt former metaphor: For if it bee an honour to bee wrought and carued, and euery way made fitte to be coupled to ſuch a precious cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone as Chriſt Ieſus is, how much greater honour is it, to bee made an houſe for Chriſt himſelfe to dwell in? yea, for him, not onely as man, but alſo as God and man? Hauing beene before habitations of Satan, <hi>and houſes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ſpirits: Mat. 12. 43. &amp;c.</hi> Is it not an honourable change of ſuch to be made houſes: houſes? yea, more then houſes: For God filleth all things and all things; (in ſome ſort, as touching the eſſence of GOD, euen the wicked them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18428:90"/> are full of God: Is it not (I ſay) an honourable change of ſuch as we were, to bee made houſes, yea more then houſes, euen <hi>holy houſes, tabernacles, and temples of the liuing God? 1. Cor.</hi> 3. 16. and 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. verily touching this matter, this ſecond Scripture before alledged, is the more to be obſerued, becauſe with the former point, of men to be houſes and tabernacles and temples for God himſelfe, and of Gods dwelling among men, and familiar walking or conuerſing with them, the Apoſtle ioineth alſo another ancient promiſe of God, viz. <hi>that be would be a father vnto them, and that they ſhould be ſonnes and daughters vnto him. 2. Cor.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. 11. 12. For by this conioining of theſe two together, the Apoſtle doth moſt plainly teach that the former honour of being Tabernacles and Temples for God, is proper onely to them that <hi>are the ſonnes &amp; daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The dignity of the children of God in reſpect of this meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, is yet the greater, becauſe as the whole world in all the beautie of it, was at the firſt made a palace for man to dwell in, ſo man himſelfe in this ſecond creation, is made a palace for God to dwell in.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſixt former metaphor, is it not more then meruailous, that ſuch vile perſons as we naturally are (euen little better then limmes of the diuell, at leaſt his children and bondſlaues, as hath beene before ſhewed) ſhould haue ſo honourable and glorious an head as Chriſt <hi>Ieſus is that ſitteth at the right hand of God in the heauen, and hath the Angels</hi> (good and bad) <hi>in ſubiection vnto him? 1. Pet.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
               <p>Beſides all before ſpoken of the excellency of Chriſt (in ſpeaking of him as of one of the efficient cauſes of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation) is he not moſt excellently alſo deſcribed <hi>to bee clothed with a garment downe to the feete, and girded about his pappes with a golden girdle? to haue his head alſo and haires white as white wooll and ſnow? and his eies as a flame of fire?</hi> yea, to haue <hi>his feete like vnto fine braſſe burning as in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace? and a voice as the ſound of many waters?</hi> yea, to haue (further) <hi>in his right hand ſeuen ſtarres, a ſharp two edged ſword going out of his mouth, and his face ſhining as the ſunne
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18428:90"/> ſhineth in his ſtrength? Reuelation.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is the dignity of the children of God thus ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in reſpect that they haue ſo excellent a head (excellent for power, for wiſedome, for iuſtice, for meeknes, for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for all things that are excellent) but alſo becauſe as Chriſt hath no other body then his Church, ſo the Church hath no other head but Chriſt Ieſus: and as none doth or can giue life to other, either to quicken them from the death of ſinne here, or to raiſe them at the latter day (when before that, by the doctrine of the Papiſts themſelues, the Pope ſhall be ſuppreſſed) as none (I ſay) can thus giue life to men but onely Chriſt Ieſus (for who dareth ſay that the Pope can raiſe vp a man either from his ſinne, or from the graue, eſpecially when the Pope himſelfe ſhall be dead?) ſo none is or can be the head of the Church but only Chriſt. Sith therefore Chriſt is not onely ſo excellent an head, but alſo the ſole and onely head of the children of God, in this reſpect alſo it muſt bee granted, that their ſtate is ſo much the more honourable.</p>
               <p>Yea, this honour of the children of God by Chriſt Ieſus his being their head, is the more, becauſe as he hath not taken the nature of angels vpon him, but onely the nature of man, ſo hee is not the head of Angels, as he is of elect men. For as it is a monſtrous bodie that hath two heads: ſo is it no leſſe monſtrous for the bodie to bee of one nature, and the head of another. And as the Angels cannot be (neither euer are called) the members of Chriſt, ſo Chriſt cannot bee called the head of the Angels. All the members alſo of the body of Chriſt, are ſaid <hi>to grow to a perfect man in Chriſt,</hi> and euery part and member of the body of Chriſt is ſaid to receiue daily encreaſe (as it were) by nerues, &amp;c. <hi>Epheſians</hi> 4. 13. 15. 16. Let no man here miſtake me: As kings are called heads, that is, chiefe gouernours of their people, ſo Chriſt (not onely as GOD, but alſo as God and man) is the head and chiefe gouernour (and that abſolutely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch limitation as kings haue) of the Angels, as well as of all other creatures. But in that ſpeciall maner that he is head of men borne anew vnto God, hee is not the head of Angels. Therefore in this reſpect alſo the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18428:91"/> condition of Gods children is ſo much the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſeuenth and laſt former metaphor, what heart of man can conceiue the depth, the height, the bredth and the length of this loue of Chriſt, in matching and ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelfe to vs, and vs to him? that <hi>hee</hi> (I ſay) <hi>that was the heire of all things, by whom the worlds were made, and who was the brightnes of the glory, and the engrauen forme of the perſon of God the father: Hebrewes.</hi> 1. 1. 2. and <hi>beeing in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to bee equall to God. Philippians</hi> 2. 6. 7. that hee (I ſay) ſhould ſo caſt his loue and liking vpon vs, as to take vs to be his ſpouſe and wife, and that way alſo to make vs the daughters (as it were in lawe, and by marriage) to God the father? euen vs, that not onely had no portion, and were euery mothers childe of vs beggers brattes, but that alſo were baſe horne crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and had <hi>an Ammonite to our Father, and an Hittite to our mother:</hi> and that therefore (as moſt baſe children are) were in ſuch miſery as <hi>a new borne childe whoſe nauell is not cut, neither is waſhed with water to ſoften him, neither is ſalted with ſalt</hi> (for the better hardning the nauell and the whole skinne; for the better ſtrengthning of all the inward parts, and for the better decocting and conſuming of all corrupt humors) <hi>neither was ſwadled with clouts,</hi> and whom being borne in miſery <hi>there was no eie to pitie, or to ſhew compaſſion.</hi> ſo <hi>that hee lay in the open field, to all contempt, and altogether polluted with blood, Ezekiel.</hi> 16. 3. 4. 5. 6. yea, who were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deformed and misſhapen, euen a crocked generation, hauing neither good face, nor good heart, nor good eie, nor any member well proportioned: yea, being altogether alſo without witte and vnderſtanding of heauenly things (as wee haue heard) euen pure naturals (as wee ſpeake) and no more able to conceiue the things of God, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to our owne good, then very ideots. Is not this wonderfull, that ſuch an one as Chriſt was and is, ſhould ſo vnequally (in many reſpects) match himſelfe with ſuch as wee were? and that by matching himſelfe ſo with vs, ſhould make ſuch a change in vs: of crooked to make vs
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18428:91"/> ſtraight: of deformed to make vs beautifull: of beggerly to make vs rich: of fooles to make vs wiſe: of prophane to make vs holy: of earthly to make vs heauenly: and of children of the diuell, to make vs the children of God his father? What a preferment therefore is this? Were it not a great aduancement and a matter of exceeding honor for a mighty Prince to take ſome vagabond woman, poore, naked, deformed, miſerable, &amp;c. and to marry her to himſelfe, and to put her preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all coſtly and princely robes? yea, it was an honor for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e and Lord of all things?</p>
               <p>Verily this match is ſo much greater preferment of vs, then the former matches were, either of <hi>Abigail</hi> with <hi>Dauid,</hi> or of <hi>Eſter</hi> with <hi>Ahaſhueroſh,</hi> becauſe both <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> had many other wiues beſides thoſe: but Chriſt Ieſus hath ſo matched himſelfe with vs, that as he had no other before vs, ſo he deſireth no other beſides vs, but contenteth himſelfe wholly with vs, and taketh as great delight in vs, as if we had been his equals when he firſt made choice of vs: and as though we had been as wiſe, rich, beautifull, vertuous, and euery way as glorious, as either he doth make vs (after his marying of vs) in this life; or as hee will make vs hereafter in the life to come.</p>
               <p>To leaue theſe metaphors and ſimilitudes, whereby hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the communion of the children of God is ſo deſcribed, and their dignity in ſuch ſort amplified, let vs further vnderſtand that our ſaid communion, is the more admirable in it ſelfe, and honorable to vs, in as much as thereby we cannot but haue communion alſo with the Father: becauſe <hi>Chriſt and the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18428:92"/> father are one: Ioh.</hi> 10. 30 And <hi>the father is in the Sonne, and the Sonne in the Father: Ioh.</hi> 14. 10. 11. In which laſt place our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour praieth, <hi>that as he and the father are one in another,</hi> ſo alſo the children of God <hi>(whom God had giuen to Chriſt: Ioh.</hi> 6. 37. and 17. 6.) <hi>might be one,</hi> (not only amongſt themſelues, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo) <hi>in them,</hi> that is, <hi>in the father and in the Sonne.</hi> Therefore our Sauiour likewiſe ſaith before, <hi>If any man loue me, he will keepe my word: and my father will loue him, and we will come vnto him, and will dwell with him: Ioh.</hi> 14. 23. Yea therefore Chriſt came into the world, and was made one with vs, that we might haue communion with the Father, and be made one with him: and as he was made one with vs to make vs one with the father, ſo alſo he did effect that for which he did come. Therefore the Apoſtle hauing ſet forth our miſerable ſtate in the world by nature, viz. that amongſt other things, <hi>we were without God in the world: Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. he doth preſently by way of oppoſition adde our contrary ſtate in Chriſt, and by Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>But in Chriſt Ieſus ye which once were farre of, are made neerer by the bloud of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> verſ. 13.</p>
               <p>Hauing that communion with the Father, and with the ſonne, we haue alſo the like with the holy ghoſt: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not onely ſaid that <hi>they that are led by the ſpirit of God are the ſonnes of God,</hi> but alſo <hi>that they that are the ſonnes of God, haue receiued the ſpirit of God, whereby they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rie Abba father: Rom.</hi> 8. 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and againe: <hi>that becauſe they are ſonnes, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into their hearts, which crieth Abba father.</hi> Therefore alſo our Sauiour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. (where he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the communion of himſelfe and of his father, vnto his diſciples) promiſeth alſo to ſend the holy ghoſt, which ſhould abide with them. Therefore alſo the holy ghoſt is ſaid <hi>to bee ſhed on vs abundantly, through Ieſus Christ our Sauiour: Tit.</hi> 3. 5. Finally, as by the ſonne we haue communion with the father, ſo the holy ghoſt is the bond of our communion with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and with the ſonne. <hi>Through him</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) wee haue an entrance to the father by one ſpirit: Epheſ.</hi> 2. 18. and <hi>by one ſpirit we are all baptized into one body, &amp;c. 1. Cor.</hi> 12. 13.</p>
               <p>Is not this then a great dignity? For this is one of the ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt promiſes that God hath made vnto his people, namely,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18428:92"/> that <hi>he will ſet his tabernacle among them, and that his ſoule ſhall not loath them, that alſo he will walke among them, &amp;c. Leuit.</hi> 26. 11. 12. So then they with whom God hath ſuch communion, as to ſet his tabernacle among them, and dwell with them, may aſſure themſelues that God will neuer loath them, nor leaue them: Yea, we doe thereby further ſee, that he promiſeth not only his preſence but alſo his gratious preſence, by his power to vphold them, by his grace to direct them, and by his goodneſſe to giue them euery good thing. For <hi>hee is greater then all, Ioh.</hi> 10. 29. both in power and wiſedome. Who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can deſtroy or hurt them, whom he will preſerue? In a ſtrange country, and in places of danger, oh how great a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is it to haue ſome companie? In ſuch a place the truth of that is moſt apparant that <hi>Two are better then one, becauſe if they fall, the one will lift vp his fellow: Eccleſ.</hi> 4. 9. 10. But alas, what is all the company of man, in reſpect of the ſociety of God? They that haue God ſo with them, may truly ſay, <hi>If God be with vs, who can be</hi> (or what skilleth it who be) <hi>againſt vs? God is light, and in him is no darkneſſe: 1. Ioh.</hi> 1. 5. If therefore we haue him alwaies with vs, we ſhall be ſure of light, whereby ſo to ſee our waies, that we may not erre. Yea <hi>God is the father of lights, from whom commeth euery good and perfect gift: Iames</hi> 1. 17. Therefore they that haue him <hi>their ſhepheard,</hi> may aſſure themſelues <hi>they ſhall want nothing, but that he will make them to reſt in green paſtures, and lead them by the still waters of life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring their ſoules and guiding them into the paths of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Pſal.</hi> 23. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, they that haue thus God their ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, ſhall be ſure not only of green paſtures, and water, but alſo that he will <hi>giue them that wine and milke, and bread, &amp;c. whereby their ſoules may liue, and be made fat</hi> to eternall life. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>What a priuiledge is this? It is a great prerogatiue of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, to be garded by an Angel, as afterward wee ſhall heare. But alas, ſmal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort is there in the preſence of an Angel if God himſelfe be not with vs. When the Iſraelites had ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God, and prouoked his wrath againſt them by making a molten calfe, that he denied to go himſelfe with them vnto the land which he had promiſed them, and yet at the praier
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:18428:93"/> of <hi>Moſes</hi> was content <hi>to ſend an Angell before them to caſt out the Canaanites, the Amerites, the Hittites, &amp;c.</hi> How (I pray you) did they take this? It is ſaid that <hi>when they heard this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, they ſorrowed, and no man put on his beſt raiment: Exod.</hi> 33. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is therefore no comfort in the preſence of any creature whatſoeuer, if God himſelfe be not graciouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, with the eies of his fauour to behold them and their ſlate, with the eares <hi>of his grace to heare their crie: Pſal.</hi> 34. 15. and with <hi>the right hand of his power,</hi> to ſupport them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 7. and <hi>to fill them with good things: Pſal.</hi> 104. 28. and 145 16. Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe in the three and thirtith of <hi>Exodus</hi> before alledged, vpon Gods deniall of his going in perſon with the Iſraelites, (offering notwithſtanding to ſend an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell before them) <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe (I ſay) reaſoneth the caſe with God in theſe words. ſaying, <hi>Wherein ſhall it be knowen that I and thy people haue found fauour in thy ſight? Shall it not be when thou goeſt with vs? So I and thy people ſhall haue preheminence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the people that are vpon the earth:</hi> verſ. 16. As the former ſorrowing of the people in the beginning of the Chapter ſheweth how heauy a thing it is to want Gods companie, though we haue the company of Angels, ſo what can be more plainly ſpoken then theſe words of <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſhew how great preheminence there is in that gratious preſence of God wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of now we ſpeake?</p>
               <p>This priuiledge is the more, becauſe as all the points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore handled, ſo this is both common to all the children of God and alſo peculiar to them only. For it is apropriated to <hi>them that are elected, called, inſtified,</hi> and which ſhall be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 31. and therefore before our calling (as wee haue heard) we are ſaid <hi>to be without God in the world: Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. and it is before obſerued, that the promiſe of Gods dwelling with men, and making them his tabernacles and temple, is ioined with another of making them alſo <hi>his ſonnes, and his daughters:</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. as noting that it is both common to them all, and alſo proper to them only.</p>
               <p>Therefore the wicked haue no more part in this priuiledge then in the former. As the children of God may ſay, that when they are alone they are not alone, becauſe God (euen the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:18428:93"/> ſonne, and holy ghoſt) is alwaies with them: ſo whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer company elſe the wicked haue, yet they may truly ſay they are alone; becauſe God (euen the father, Sonne and holy Ghoſt) is abſent from them.</p>
               <p>As God is infinit and filleth all places, ſo he cannot but be whereſoeuer the wicked are. But cold is the comfort of this his preſence only. For if their eies were opened to ſee him, they ſhould ſee him no otherwiſe then <hi>Dauid ſaw the Angell of the Lord, between the earth and the heauen with his ſword drawen in his hand, and ſtretched out toward Ieruſalem:</hi> 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 16. What to do had the Angell of the Lord <hi>his hand ſo ſtretched out toward Ieruſalem?</hi> euen <hi>to deſtroy it:</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 16.</p>
               <p>Neither any otherwiſe ſhould the wicked ſee the Lord to be preſent (if their eies were opened) <hi>then Balaams Aſſe ſaw alſo</hi> the ſame or another Angell of the Lord <hi>stand in the way, and a ſword drawn in his hand,</hi> at the ſight whereof, the Aſſe being ſtricken with feare flung the firſt time out of the way into the field: and the ſecond time daſnt her maſters foot againſt the wall: and the third time lay down vnder him, not daring to go in the way: <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 23.</p>
               <p>Thus (I ſay) and no otherwiſe, ſhould the wicked ſee the Lord preſent with them, not to do them any good, but to be reuenged of them for all their wickedneſſe. Thereby they ſhould be ſo filled and poſſeſſed with feare, that they ſhould be ready to fly (if it were poſſible) and to run away from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But <hi>whither ſhould they flie from his preſence? If they ſhould aſcend into heauen, be is there: If they ſhould goe down into hell (or make their bed in the graue) hee is there: If they ſhould take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the vttermoſt parts of the ſea, yet thither ſhould his hand follow them; and his right hand bold them from eſcaping. If they ſhould ſay, the darknes ſhall hide vs, the night ſhould be light round about them: Pſal.</hi> 139. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore if God he thus from them touching his grace and only preſent in his wrath, power &amp; iuſtice againſt them, what (alas) ſhall it boote them to haue any of his creatures with them? Truly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all: They were as good be alone. If <hi>Salomon</hi> ſay, <hi>Wo vnto him that is alone: for hee falleth, and there is no: aſecond to to helpe himvp: Eccleſ.</hi> 4. 10. how much more wocfull is the ſtate
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:18428:94"/> of the wicked, that are altogether deſtitute of the gracious preſence of God? For if he withdraw himſelfe from them, who dareth accompany them for any good?</p>
               <p>By theſe things we ſee, how great the prerogatiue of the children of God is by their communion with God. But this is not all: For this communion with Chriſt Ieſus, (and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently with the other two perſons in the deity) is the more excellent, not onely in reſpect of the excellency of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with whom our baſe nature is vnited; neither in other reſpects before ſpoken: but alſo becauſe being once made, it is indiſſoluble, and vnteparable. All the vnions before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whereunto this vnion metaphorically and by way of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude is reſembled, may be diſſolued: For the garment put on is alſo put off: The moſt of our meat and drinke (touching the matter thereof) is eiected and caſt out: The vine and the branches, as alſo any other tree and the boughs, may be diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the axe, or ſome other toole: So may the corner ſtone and the reſt of the building therewith coupled: The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant or tenant is oft times turned out of his houſe; yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the lawfull owner is caſt out of his owne free-hold: The naturall head and the naturall body, yea the body and the ſoule of man are for a time ſeparated by death: Finally by the ſame meanes, there is a ſeparation betwixt the man and the wife. But nothing whatſoeuer can euer diſſolue the vnion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the children of God and God himſelfe, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>As the perſonall vnion betwixt the two natures in Chriſt, (the Godhead and the manhood) could not be diſſolued; euen when the humanity it ſelfe (touching the parts thereof) was by death for a time diſſolued (the ſoule being in heauen with the father, and the body lying in the graue) but the knot once knit did continue in death it ſelfe, and ſhall continue for euer: ſo alſo is the vnion, betwixt God and the children of God an euerlaſting vnion. As therefore the miſery of man, is in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of man from God (who is bleſſed for euer, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe it ſelfe) ſo the happineſſe of man is in his vnion and communion with God, eſpecially in the continuance thereof for euer.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:18428:94"/>
               <p>As all the wicked and vngodly are moſt miſerable by their being without God in the world, (as before wee haue heard) euen ſo long as they ſo continue, becauſe all that while they are as farre from heauen, as earth; yea as hell it ſelfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in darkneſſe and in the power of ſatan, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. (oh wofull condition!) ſo all the children of God, hauing in their adoption this communion with God, are happy and ten times happy, becauſe the benefit and comfort thereof hath no end.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O proceed a little further into the foreſaid communion of the children of God with Chriſt Ieſus, and by Chriſt Jeſus with the father and with the holy ghoſt: let vs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more behold the excellency thereof, by ſuch benefits as the children of God doe thereby enioy: wherein all wicked and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall men (ſo continuing) haue no part or portion.</p>
               <p>Here let vs firſt conſider the great benefit of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. It is indeed a principall point (as hath been before obſerued) of that mercy of God which was one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall motiues of God to worke the worke of our regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And of that mercy of God I haue ſpoken a little generally before: Notwith ſtanding this particular point thereof tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes is a little more largely here to be handled, becauſe this place (in ſome reſpects) is fitter for that purpoſe then the former: the rather becauſe it is not onely to be conſidered as a cauſe of regeneration, but alſo as an effect and fruit of our foreſaid communion with God.</p>
               <p>Touching this benefit therefore, that it is by our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt Ieſus, it is manifeſt, becauſe he is ſaid to be <hi>the reconciliation for our ſinnes, and not only for our ſinnes, but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole world: 1. Ioh. 2. 2. By reconciliation for our
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18428:95"/> ſinnes, and for the ſinnes of the whole world,</hi> the Apoſtle meaneth, the ſinnes both of all already regenerated and new borne; and alſo of other the elect of God in the world, remaining yet in their naturall and vnregenerate ſtate. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaith <hi>that Chriſt gaue himſelfe for vs, that he might redeeme vs from all iniquity: &amp;c. Tit.</hi> 2. 19. What is it to redeem vs from all iniquity, but to purchaſe a free and abſolute pardon for vs of all our ſinnes?</p>
               <p>Moreouer he ſaith, that <hi>in Chriſt we haue redemption through his bloud, the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes according to his rich grace: Epheſ.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 14. In both which places let this be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, <note place="margin">Note.</note> that the Apoſtle interpreteth the redemption of the elect to be <hi>the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> Why ſhall we ſo obſerue this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the word <hi>redemption?</hi> Becauſe thereby the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle inſinuateth a twofold or double redemption wrought by Ieſus Chriſt: one proper onely to the elect, conſiſting in the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and other things depending thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the other common to all, as well to the reprobate as to the elect. But what is this ſo common a redemption? viz. It is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe from the bondage and obedience of the ancient cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall law: touching the going diuers times of the yeere to Ieruſalem, and performing there diuers rites and ceremonies in the worſhip of God: namely the paiment of tithes, and of firſt fruits: the bringing of diuers oblations and ſacrifices: as alſo touching diuers kinds of waſhings, and clenſing men of the leproſie, of pollution by handling the dead, by any iſſue, &amp;c. and concerning likewiſe abſtinence from diuers kinds both of fiſh and fleſh, and many other the like things. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption (I ſay) of men from obedience of theſe things is common to the reprobate and not peculiar to the elect. For Chriſt Ieſus hath ſo nailed the whole law of ceremonies and ordinances to his croſſe, that although Chriſt were taken down from the ſaid croſſe, that although Chriſt were taken down from the ſaid croſſe, yet they ſhall (as it were) ſo remaine faſt fixed thereunto, that they ſhall neuer come downe, or be in force with men by anv authoritv from God. This is plainly taught, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 14. The words are commonly known, therſore I do no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſet them down.</p>
               <p>As in the time of the law, before the comming of Chriſt, though the Iewes were bound to obedience of the ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18428:95"/> lawe, and did therefore ſinne, if they did not obſerue the ſame: yet the Gentiles (not incorporated into the Iewes) were free from it, and did not offend either by eating any thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to the Iewe; or by intermitting any other rite of the ſayd lawe: ſo now all that lawe being by Chriſt diſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, all are at libertie both the Iewes as well as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: and therefore the Iewes do no more offend now, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing contrary to any point of the ceremoniall lawe then the Gentiles did in former time. Al men therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, as well the wicked as the godly are partaker of this redemption and liberty: ſo that the wicked (of what nation ſoeuer) doe no more offend in eating of ſwines fleſh, or of any other meate forbidden in the lawe, then they doe offend in eating of beefe or mutton, or of any other thing, that was alwaies permitted by the law. The ſame is to be ſaid of doing any thing elſe contrary to any clauſe of the ceremoniall lawe.</p>
               <p>This is a great libertie and redemption. For certainely the obſeruation of the ceremonies of the lawe could not but be a great bondage in reſpect both of the charge by firſt fruits, ſacrifices and other oblations beſide tithes: and alſo of the paines in going ſo often euery yeere to Ieruſalem, in what place ſoeuer of the land they did dwell. Beſides, it could not but be ſomewhat tedious to vſe ſo many waſhings and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings: to be bound likewiſe to make fringes vpon garments; and not to weare a garment of linſie wolſie. The like may bee ſaid of diuers other things; eſpecially it could not but be very greeuous to be reſtrained from ſo many kindes of meates, as are now accounted dainty: viz from the heron, from the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhank, from the lapwing (or as ſome other interpret the word, from that dainty fowle that is called a good wit) from the ſea mewe, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hare, from the conie, from all kind of ſhel-fiſh, becauſe no ſhel fiſh hath any ſcales or ſins: &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuers other the like things: to be (I ſay) reſtrained fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe things could not but be very grieuous. To be therfore enlarged in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe is to be acknowledged a great rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, a great liberty: notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, that which is proper to the elect, is much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This is alſo twofold: one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the guilt &amp; puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſin,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18428:96"/> other from the ſpot and blemiſh, or ſeruitude and bondage therof. Theſe may be better diſtinguiſhed in nature, then ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in time. For they do alwaies concurre and go together: where there is the firſt, there is alwaies the ſecond: &amp; where is the ſecond, there is alſo the former. As ſoone as any is diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the guilt and puniſhment of ſin, ſo ſoone is the ſame party purged of the blot and blemiſh, and releaſed of the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and ſeruitude of ſinne. And where any is purged of the blot and blemiſh and releaſed of the ſeruitude and bondage of ſinne, there likewiſe is a diſcharge from the guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſinne. For that faith that layeth hold of Chriſt without for the former, ſo layeth hold alſo of him within for the latter; that Chriſt dwelling in vs by faith, doth both purge vs of the ſpot and ſtaine of ſinne, and alſo releaſe vs from the ſlauery and thraldome of ſinne. Therefore in the place before alledged, it is not onely ſaid that <hi>Chriſt gaue himſelfe for vs that he might redeeme vs from all iniquitie,</hi> but the other is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo added, <hi>viz. that he might purge vs, &amp;c.</hi> theſe two are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ioyned together, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 30. Where (as before hath beene ſhewed) the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>that Chriſt is made vnto vs, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption.</hi> The former <hi>(viz.</hi> releaſe from the guilt and puniſhment of ſinne) is to bee vnderſtood by the word <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> the ſecond by the two words following, <hi>ſanctification and redemption:</hi> or the word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption there in the laſt place, may be taken as comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the other two words before, <hi>righteouſneſſe and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> as if the Apoſtle ſhould haue ſaid, Chriſt is made vnto vs <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> wherby we are diſcharged from al our ſinnes in the ſight of God, and <hi>ſanctification,</hi> whereby we are releaſed from the bondage of ſinne in our ſelues; and ſo he is made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs perfect redemption; both as touching the guilt and puniſhment of our ſinnes, and alſo as touching our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from the ſlauery therof. <hi>Zachary</hi> alſo ioyneth both theſe together in words much like to thoſe of <hi>Paul</hi> vnto <hi>Titus,</hi> ſaying that <hi>hee hath deliuered vs from the hands of all our enemies that wee might ſerue him without feare in all holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. Luk.</hi> 1. 74. Deliuerance from our enemies
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18428:96"/> doth ſignify our releaſe from the puniſhment of ſinne, and <hi>to ſerue God without feare in holineſſe, &amp;c</hi> doth import a freedom from the bondage of ſinne: both becauſe the ſeruant of ſinne cannot be the ſeruant of God: For <hi>no man can ſerue two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters:</hi> (eſpecially ſo contrary one to other, as ſinne and God, yea as ſinne and <hi>holines and righteouſneſſe)</hi> Math. 6. 24 and alſo becauſe <hi>the ſeruice of God</hi> is ſayd <hi>to be without feare.</hi> But in all bondage there is ſome feare. To ſhut vp this point, this I adde further, that though our clenſing from the blot of ſinne, and our releaſe from the ſlauery of ſinne, be but in part, and al to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether imperfect in this life (according notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to that which before I haue ſaid in this behalfe) yet our releaſe and diſcharge from the guilt and puniſhment of ſin is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus noted, firſt that there is a double redemption, one common to all; the other peculiar to the elect: Secondly that the redemption peculiar to the elect is alſo double, one from the guilt, the other from the ſpot of ſinne; for applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on let vs vnderſtand that the Apoſtle expreſſely ſpeaketh in the places before all eaged, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 14. of the former, viz. of our diſcharge from the guilt of ſin expreſſed by this phraſe of <hi>the forgiuenes of ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, touching this phraſe of <hi>hauing redemption in Chriſt,</hi> it is not ſo to be vnderſtood, as though we had onely forgiuenes of ſins by Chriſts dwelling in our hearts by faith: for Chriſt neither can nor will dwell in vs, till ous ſins be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen: ſo long as our ſins are not forgiuen wee are Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and Chriſt neither can nor will dwell in the harts of them that are Gods enemies: and ſo forgiuenes of ſinnes muſt needs be in order before Chriſt take vp our hearts for his habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Againe, Chriſts dwelling in our hearts by faith, is rather an aſſurance of our foreſayd redemption and iuſtification (that is, of the forgiuenes of ſinnes) then our ſayd redemption and iuſtification it ſelfe. It is alſo to be obſerued, that he ſaith not that we are redeemed by him, but that wee haue <hi>redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in him.</hi> For therby he the better noteth, that wee are not onely redeemed by Chriſt, that is, that Chriſt hath not onely bought and paide for the forgiuenes of our ſinnes, which one
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18428:97"/> day we ſhall haue, but that all already borne againe, alreadie alſo are in poſſeſſion of the ſayd redemption, and already haue the forgiuenes of ſinnes; and that ſo our ſayd forgiueneſſe of ſinnes is the more certaine vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Laſt of al, this phraſe, <hi>in him,</hi> is very ſignificant, as nothing our redemption and iuſtification there ſpoken of, not onelie to be by Chriſt, but alſo in Chriſt: nothing at all in vs, but wholly without vs, and altogether in Chriſt; as the ſinnes for which Chriſt was put to death in our behalfe were altogether without him, and in vs, nothing at all in himſelfe.</p>
               <p>This redemption <hi>(the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes)</hi> is to be accounted as the fountaine of all other benefits following the ſame, and belongeth onely to the children of God.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt, (that forgiuenes of ſins is the fountain of all other benefits following the ſame, the Lord promiſing to make a couenant with his people, <hi>for putting his lawes into their inward parts, and writing them in their hearts, and for himſelfe to be their God, and them to be his people,</hi> he addeth this as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and fountaine of all the former articles of his ſayd newe couenant, <hi>that he would forgiue their iniquity and remember their ſinnes no more, Ierem.</hi> 31. 33. 34. The Prophet Dauid alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking <hi>his owne ſoule to praiſe the Lord, and all that was within him to praiſe his holy name, and not to forget his benefits,</hi> ſetteth <hi>the forgiuenes of all his ſinnes</hi> in the firſt place, before <hi>the healing of all his infirmittes, the redeeming his life from the graue,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other benefits following, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thereby noting the forgiuenes of ſins to be the firſt &amp; the cauſe of al the other.</p>
               <p>That this forgiuenes of ſins is proper onely to the children of God, as it doth appeare by the place of <hi>Ieremie</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, where it is ioyned <hi>with writing his lawes in their hearts, and Gods being their God, and their being his people,</hi> which to be all one with his being their Father, and their beeing his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren hath beene ſhewed before, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. and as the ſame is alſo apparent by other ſcriptures before produced, wherein the forgiuenes of ſins is ioyned with our purging or clenſing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſin (a thing peculiar onely to Gods children) ſo the ſayd point is further euident, becauſe <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo ioyneth <hi>the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes, with an heart without guile. Pſal.</hi> 32. 1. 2.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:18428:97"/>
               <p>The mercy of God likewiſe (which chiefly conſiſteth in the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rgiueneſſe of ſinnes) is reſtrained in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 11. 12. to them only that truely feare God. The children of God doe onely feare God truly: therefore the children of God haue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſt in the forgiuenes of ſinnes, and in <hi>remoouing them as farre from them, as the East is from the Weſt.</hi> Therefore alſo all theſe three, the grace, faith, the title ſonne, and the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſins are ioined all together. <hi>When Ieſus ſaw their faith</hi> (viz. the faith of them that brought the palſie man, and the faith of the palſie man himſelfe) <hi>hee ſaid vnto him, Sonne thy ſinnes are forgiuen: Mat.</hi> 9. 2. <hi>Mark.</hi> 2. 5.

               <p>Naturally the children of God are as well <hi>the children of wrath</hi> as any other: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 3. viz. before their actuall adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yea, ſometimes before their ſaid actuall adoption and conuerſion they are greater ſinners then other. Is not this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the example of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> of the theeſe vpon the Croſſe, of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> that ran away from his maſter, and carried alſo with him ſome of his goods, and that for ſome other ſuch like thing ſeemeth to haue been committed to the priſon where <hi>Paul</hi> was, and where <hi>Paul</hi> in his bonds conuerted him? And this the Lord doth, the more to magnifie the riches of his grace towards ſuch, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter encouragement of other to ſeeke for the like mercy: 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. as alſo to teach them that haue ſuch experience of his mercy in forgiuing them their ſo great ſinnes both <hi>to loue him much,</hi> according <hi>to that much that is forgiuen them: Luk.</hi> 7. 47. and alſo to loue their brethren the more, and to be the more tender towards them, and the more ready to forgiue them wherein ſoeuer they ſhall treſpaſſe againſt them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 32. 33. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 32.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus ſhewed the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes to be onely in Chriſt, and by our communion with him, &amp;c. as alſo to be the fountaine of all other benefits, and proper and peculiar only to the children of God, let vs now alſo ſee the greatneſſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18428:98"/> of this benefit.</p>
               <p>This therefore is manifeſt, becauſe <hi>Dauid</hi> pronounceth him <hi>bleſſed whoſe wickedneſſe is forgiuen, whoſe ſinne is couered, and to whom the Lord imputeth not his iniquity: Pſal.</hi> 32. 1. 2. What can be more then to <hi>be bleſſed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame likewiſe appeareth by diuers compariſons of ſinne in the Scripture. For it is compared to ſickneſſe, <hi>The whole need not the phiſitian but the ſicke: Mat.</hi> 9. 12. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this compariſon ſeem to be theſe. As ſickneſſe taketh away our ſtomacks from bodily meat, ſo doth ſinne from the food of our ſoules, and <hi>from the meat that abideth to eternall life:</hi> Yea, it maketh ſuch ſpirituall food to be much more loathſom vnto vs, then all or any bodily meat is to any ſicke of any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>As ſickneſſe taketh away our taſte and relliſh of all bodily nouriſhment, both meat and drinke, making that which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time we thought very pleaſant, and which is ſo in it ſelfe, to be bitter and moſt vnſauory: ſo ſinne maketh the very word of God in itſelfe <hi>ſweeter then hony, and the hony combe: Pſal.</hi> 19. 10. to be as gall or wormwood vnto vs.</p>
               <p>As ſickneſſe taketh away the ſtrength of the yongeſt and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtieſt, and maketh them not able to goe vp and downe the houſe: much leſſe to beare any burdens, or to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt their enemies, &amp;c. ſo ſinne diſableth a man from going about the works of God and of his own ſaluation: from bearing any croſſes either from God, or from men: and from reſiſting the enemies that fight againſt his ſoule.</p>
               <p>As ſickneſſe taketh away a mans knowledge and memory euen of his beſt friends, and maketh him to ſpeake idely with his tongue, and with his hand to reach and to ketch he cannot tell at what, ſo by ſinne we are bereaued of all good knowledge and memory: yea, and ſpeake idly and wickedly: and doe occupie our hands and other members with matters altogether vnprofitable, <hi>where there is no fruit, and whereof</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter recouery of health, and true knowledge) <hi>wee are aſhamed. Rom.</hi> 6. 21.</p>
               <p>As ſickneſſe continued and not recouered cauſeth death at the laſt: ſo <hi>ſinne when it is finiſhed</hi> (and as it were thoroughly

               <p>Sinne is likewiſe compared to an heauy and intolerable burden, <hi>Come vnto me all ye that are weary and heauy laden</hi> (viz. with your ſinnes) <hi>and I will refreſh you: Mat.</hi> 11. 28. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cain</hi> complained that <hi>his ſinne was greater then hee could beare: Geneſ.</hi> 4. 13. And (alas) ſo heauy was the burden of ſinne vpon Iudas, that to eaſe himſelfe of that burden hee did not onely caſt away, or deliuer againe <hi>to the cheefe Prieſts and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the thirty peeces of ſiluer which he had taken (as wages of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe) to betray the innocent bloud of Chriſt, but</hi> that alſo <hi>departing</hi> afterward (in moſt dolefull ſort) <hi>he went</hi> (and moſt deſperately) <hi>hanged himſelfe Mat.</hi> 27. 3. The like fearefull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of the heauy burden of ſinne we do too often ſee by too many examples. Wee heard alſo before that the very imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely of our ſinnes to Chriſt Ieſus, the ſonne of God &amp; God himſelfe, made him not only exceedingly to feare, and in his feare <hi>to offer vp praiers and ſupplications with ſtrong crying &amp; teares vnto God. Heb</hi> 5. 7. but alſo <hi>to ſweat water and bloud Luk.</hi> 22. 44. and laſtly to cry out moſt bitterly vpon the croſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden of our ſinnes: <hi>My God, my God why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me' Mat.</hi> 27. 46.</p>
               <p>That ſome men feele not the ſicknes and waight of ſinne, it is becauſe of another compariſon alſo of ſinne, viz. vnto death itſelfe; <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliuer mee out of this body of death, Rom.</hi> 7. 24. <hi>And you that were dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes, &amp;c. Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1. As men therefore that are dead, though they died with an hundred plague-ſores about them not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or hauing the waight of a great Church vpon them, doe feele nothing either of ſuch ſores, or of ſuch waight: euen ſo is to bee ſayd of them that feele not either the ſickneſſe or the heauineſſe of ſinne, namely, that it is, becauſe they are dead in their ſinne.</p>
               <p>By theſe things we ſee, that all whoſe ſinnes are forgiuen, are rid and healed of ſo many diſeaſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 3. and releaſed of ſo many burdens as they haue ſinnes: and finally that <hi>they are tranſlated from death to life.</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 14. Is not then the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſinnes a ſingular benefit?</p>
               <p>Moreouer the greatnes of this benefit doth further appeare
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18428:99"/> by another compariſon of ſinne, viz. vnto debt: <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which reſpect Chriſt teacheth vs to pray, <hi>Forgiue vs our debts, Mat.</hi> 6. 12. Yea, he whoſe ſinne is leaſt, is more in Gods debt, then he is able any way to diſcharge. Therefore in the parable of two debters, he that owed but <hi>fifty pence</hi> is ſayd to haue beene as vnable to pay as he that owed <hi>ſiue hundred pence. Luke</hi> 7. 41. 42. Is it not a great miſery, yea a kind of hell tormenting a man, to be in greater debt then he is able to fatiſſie? Indeed ſome men are ſo deſperate, that they bid their creditors take care how to come by that that is owing vnto them, for they will take no care to pay any man: therefore they borrow of euery man, and pay (almoſt) no man: ſo that it is half a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what becommeth of all the mony they doe borrow. But though ſome be thus leaudly minded, yet moſt men haue ſo much ciuill honeſty (at the leaſt) by the light of nature, that they finde it very greeuous and troubleſome continually to their minds, to owe more the they can pay. Al debt alſo aboue ability to pay is the more grecuous, the greater and mightier the creditor is to whom the ſame is owing. How great then is the debt of man vnto God by ſinnelyea by the leaſt ſin! The danger of the leaſt ſinne (much more of many and great ſins) is the curſe of God, and euerlaſting condemnation of body &amp; ſoule: euen an infinit puniſhment according to the infinit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty of God that is by ſin offended. Who the can expreſſe the greatnes of the benefit of forgiuenes of ſinnes? It is a great benefit to be out of debt with men; ſo that a man may walke &amp; go any where ſecurely without danger: much more then is the benefite of the diſcharge of all our debt with God.</p>
               <p>Laſt of al, ſinne againſt God is compared vnto treaſon, and rebellion againſt a prince: 1. <hi>Sam. 15. 23. Lamon. 3. 42. Dan.</hi> 5. 9. As therefore it is a great benefit for a traitour and rebell to bee pardoned by his Soueraigne, ſo is it not ſo much the more to be pardoned by God himſelfe of all our treaſons and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt him, by how much hee is greater then all earthlie princes? Verily this is not only more then any tongue of man can expreſſe, but alſo then any heart of man or wiſedome of Angels can comprehend.</p>
               <p>The ſame benefit of forgiuenes of ſinnes is yet the greater
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18428:99"/> becauſe to whom God remitteth one ſinne, to him hee remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all: and whoſe ſinnes he doth once forgiue, his ſinnes hee doth forgiue for euer: whom once he doth acquit, diſcharge and iuſtifie, them hee wil neuer condemne or cal to account.</p>
               <p>By all ſinnes, I meane al the ſinnes of Gods children both o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall and actuall; before baptiſme and after baptiſm; before conuerſion and after conuerſion; of knowledge and of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and once or often: yea as wel deliberately as vnaduiſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> in the place before vſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1. 2. ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of ſinne indefinitely, without exception of any: and in the other place praiſeth God expreſſely for <hi>forgiuing al his ſins.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith that Chriſt hath not redeemed vs from ſin, but from <hi>all iniquity: Tit.</hi> 2. 14. So likewiſe in the other places before mentioned, the Apoſtles ſpeake of ſinnes indefinitely, <hi>&amp;c. Epheſ. 1. 7. Coloſ.</hi> 1. 14. not of ſinnes before or after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, or conuerſion, &amp;c. If by Chriſt wee haue forgiueneſſe onely of originall ſinne, or of ſinnes before baptiſme, and that wee or ſome other muſt make ſatiſfaction for our actuall ſinnes, or for ſinnes after baptiſme, (as the Papiſts teach) then hath Chriſt ſatiſfied onely for the leſſe, and left the greater to vs. For who knoweth not actuall ſinnes to be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then originall? and ſinnes after baptiſme to bee more (at leaſt for moſt part) then ſinnes before baptiſme. But of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſality of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, I hope to ſpeak more (to the further comfort of ſuch as are heauy loaden with theyr ſinnes,) in another treatiſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point, that whoſe ſinnes are once remitted, they are remitted for euer, is as certaine as the former: Becauſe <hi>the couenant of the Lord is an euerlaſting couenant: and his mercies are the ſure mercies of Dauid: Iſa.</hi> 55. 3. <hi>As high as the heauen is aboue the earth, ſo great is his mercy towards them that feare him. As farre as the Eaſt is from the weſt, ſo far hath he remooued our ſins from vs. Pſ.</hi> 103. 11. 12. As therefore the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and the earth ſhall neuer come together; and as the Eaſt and the Weſt ſhall neuer meete: ſo the pardon of ſinnes once graunted by the Lord to his children, ſhall neuer be reuoked &amp; called backe.</p>
               <p>The ſame is more plainly teſtified in the prophecy of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18428:100"/> If the heauens can be meaſured, or the foundations of the earth be ſearched on: beneath, then will I caſt off all the ſeed of Iſrael, for all that they haue done, ſaith the Lord: Ier.</hi> 31. 37. The firſt of theſe things is impoſſible: to wit, the meaſuring of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, and ſearching of the bottome of the earth; therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo impoſſible is the ſecond: viz. that the Lord ſhould caſt off his people and children for their ſinnes. <hi>Can a woman</hi> (ſaith the Lord alſo) <hi>forget her child, and not haue compaſſion on the ſonne of her wombe?</hi> (note that hee vſeth the ſingular number, to teach that he compareth him not to a woman, that hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny children, but to a woman that hath but one child, and that a ſonne) <hi>Though they ſhould forget, yet will I not forget them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold I haue grauen thee vpon the palmes of my hands; thy walles are euer before me,</hi> or <hi>in my ſight: Iſai.</hi> 44. 15. 16. Is this only ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the whole body of the Church? No: It is alſo to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of euery part and member thereof: eſpecially of them that by regeneration are indeed made the children of God, as here we ſpeake; and for their ſakes only, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the body of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>The ſame is yet further teſtified: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63. 16. <hi>Doubtleſſe thou art our father.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18428:100"/> therefore is this of the children of God, ſo to haue all their great and manifold iniquities pardoned, that none of them ſhall euer be laid to their charge? as it is written <hi>Who ſhall lay anything to the charge of Gods choſen?</hi> (whom before in the ſame Chapter he had called Gods children) <hi>It is God that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth.

               <p>I might further amplifie this benefit of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, becauſe the Lord therein hath paſſed ouer the Angells that haue forſaken their ſtanding, and vouchſafed this grace onely to his children adopted amongſt men. But becauſe I haue had the like argument before therefore it ſhall not now be needfull to repeat the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thus much of this point, touching the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes proper only to the children of God, and therefore alſo of their greater dignity thereby.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the dying more and more of the children of God vnto ſinne, and of their preſeruation from many great ſinnes which the wicked doe daily commit, and of their liuing more and more to righteouſneſſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ext to the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, let vs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſider, that as before we heard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the matter wherein conſiſteth the being of the children of God, they were reſtored from the death of ſinne to the life of righteouſneſſe: ſo being thus altred and changed, they neither go backward, neither ſtand at a ſtay, but doe daily die more and more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne: and doe daily likewiſe liue more and more vnto righteouſneſſe. And thus to proceed from the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, to theſe things, is the method of the holy ghoſt in the ſcriptures. For <hi>Dauid</hi> doth not only pray <hi>to be clenſed from ſecret faults,</hi> that is, to haue ſuch ſinnes pardoned vnto him, and therefore much more to be pardoned of his open ſinnes,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18428:101"/> but alſo <hi>that hee might bee kept from preſumptuous ſinnes: Pſal.</hi> 19 12. 13. Our Sauiour alſo teacheth to pray not onely <hi>for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes,</hi> but alſo <hi>not to bee led into tentation, and to bee deliuered from euill: Mat.</hi> 6. 12. 13. Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> preacheth <hi>repentance, and forgiuenes of ſinnes together: Acts</hi> 2. 38 Touching this preſent point, as before we heard the children of God by their incorporation into Chriſt in their new birth, to be reuiued again, and made aliue to God in true knowledge and wiſedome, and in true holines and righteouſneſſe; ſo now let vs vnderſtand, that the longer the ſaid children of God continue ſo incorporated into Chriſt, the more ſap and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue they receiue from him; and that therefore that which is natural in them doth more and more decay; and that that is of grace, and by the new birth of the ſpirit, doth more and more grow and encreaſe.</p>
               <p>So it is with plantes grafted into any ſtocke: the longer they continue in the ſtocke, the more they are incorporated therinto, and the more they thriue and grow and beare fruit.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore for dying more and more vnto ſinne, or for the dying more and more of ſinne in vs, this phraſe may ſeem ſomwhat harſh &amp; ſtrange: becauſe in natural things, that that is once dead indeed, cannot properly be ſayd to die any more. There cannot bee a continuall dying, or a dying by piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meales, but where there is a remnant of life.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, firſt, that euen in naturall things, that may be ſaid to be killed, that receiueth ſuch a deadly wound that from the day of receiuing thereof it neuer thriueth or ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (as we ſpeake) but pineth &amp; waſteth away euery day more and more till it periſh. So both man, and alſo vnreaſonable creatures vpon ſome wounds giuen them by other creatures, or taken by their owne vntulines, doe many times conſume vnto death it ſelfe. So many trees being either blaſted aboue, or canker-eaten in the midſt, or hauing the ſtrings of their rootes cut beneath, do from that day wither till they bee alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether dead; aboue, in the midſt, and beneath.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let vs remember the compariſon vſed before <hi>chap</hi> 8. of ſinnes once mortified, vnto the carcaſes of men ſlaine in warre. As therefore carcaſes of men ſo ſlaine, muſt be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18428:101"/> remoued, and buried, or elſe they will bee very infectious to them that liue where ſuch dead carcaſes lye: euen ſo the dead carcaſes of our ſins mortified in vs, muſt be more and more remoued, and as it were daily buried, that ſo they may not bee infectious to the vertues that are aliue in vs. And this remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing or burying of the dead carcaſes of our ſinnes before mortified and ſlaine by the ſword of Gods ſpirit, accompanied with the reſt of the ſpirituall armour, is a kind of daily killing ſinne more and more.</p>
               <p>Wheras likewiſe before in the ſaid 8 chapter I compared the remnants of ſinne in vs to old rags or patches of an old coate vpon a newe, to the diſgrace of the ſaid new coate; the caſting &amp; ſhaking off of ſuch ſins remaining, that ſo they may not be diſgracefull to the new man which we haue put on in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, is putting off more and more of the old man, and therfore alſo a killing likewiſe or mortifying of ſin more and more in vs. For to put off the old ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to mortify &amp; crucifie ſin (wherin conſiſteth the old man) do both ſignify one thing.</p>
               <p>To proceede therefore further in this point; as the children of God are commanded thus to put off the old man daily, and thus to mortifie and crucifie the ſame, and al earthly members thereof, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4, 22. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>&amp;c,</hi> ſo the ſame commandements do imply a promiſe of a bleſſing, <hi>viz.</hi> of ſtrength and grace for performance of that which is commanded: eſpecially ſuch commandements, being not only legal but alſo euangelicall. The legall and the euangelicall commandements, teach one <note place="margin">Note.</note> thing touching the eſchewing of euill and doing of good. For euen <hi>the grace of God</hi> (that is, the goſpell) <hi>which bringeth ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all men hauing appeared</hi> (that is, in moſt bright and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maner broken foorth through the clouds of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and of the law of ordinances wherewith before it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured) <hi>doth teach vs</hi> (as it were little children) <hi>to deny all vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and worldly lusts, and to liue godly, and righteouſly, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly in this preſent world, Tit.</hi> 2. 11. 12. The ſame things the law alſo did teach. But there is a great difference betwixt the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe things by the law, and by the goſpell. For the law teacheth onely demoſtratiuely and imperatiuely, ſhewing vs what we ſhould do, &amp; commanding vs to do it: but the goſpell
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18428:102"/> teacheth operatiuely and effectiuely, giuing grace to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that which it teacheth: and therfore as the law, going no further then to ſhew and command vs what to doe, is called <hi>the letter that killeth</hi> (as a man that requires much, and giueth not wherewith to do it, doth as it were kill the heart of him, of whom he requireth ſuch things) ſo the Goſpell quickning and enabling a man to do that which it requireth, is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a quickning ſpirit:</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 36.</p>
               <p>To returne to the former point, the old man being thus daily mortified and crucified in the children of God, they haue thereby a further priuilege for their better preſeruation from preſumptuous and reprochfull ſinnes: ſo that either they fall not into them, or if they doe, it is for ſome ſpeciall good intended by God permitting them ſo to fall, and in the end they are raiſed vp againe, and made ſo much the ſtronger af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, by how much the weaker they ſhewed themſelues in their fall: and ſo much the more circumſpect and fearefull of falling againe in like manner by how much the more ſecure and fearleſſe they had been: and laſtly ſo much the more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of, and forward vnto euery good work, by how much the more grieuouſly they had before fallen into euill. And this is partly the meaning of the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn,</hi> when he ſaith that <hi>he that abideth in him</hi> (that is, in Chriſt) <hi>ſinneth not:</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 6. and againe, that <hi>he that is borne of God ſinneth not: for his ſeed remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in him, neither can be ſinne, becauſe bee is borne of God.</hi> verſ. 9. For theſe ſpeeches ſignifie, that <hi>they that are in Christ and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated,</hi> are not only ſo freed from ſinne, that it doth not raigne and beare dominion in them generally as before their regeneration and incorporation into Chriſt it did: but that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they make not a trade of any one ſinne, but that they ſo watch ouer themſelues, and are watched ouer by the Lord, that they fall not into ſuch reprochfull and diſgracefull ſinnes, as the naturall and vnregenerate men doe daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
               <p>This is more plentifully taught by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> For it is the chiefe argument of all the firſt fourteen verſes of the ſixt Chapter to the Romans.</p>
               <p>It is alſo further euident by the example of <hi>Iſaack:</hi> For
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18428:102"/> though the Lord before the birth of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid that <hi>the elder ſhould ſerue the yonger: Geneſ.</hi> 25. 23. And although <hi>Eſau</hi> had moſt wickedly and prophanely ſold his birthright vnto <hi>Iacob,</hi> verſe 33. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 16. yet <hi>Iſack</hi> had fully purpoſed to haue beſtowed the bleſſing vpon <hi>Eſau.</hi> Had not this been a matter of great reproch? For ſuch a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triark ſo to haue croſſed the former word of the Lord tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the bleſſing of <hi>Iacob?</hi> well, notwithſtanding the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Iſack.</hi> yet the Lord by the wiſedome of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, kept him from that ſinne, and directed him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the bleſſing according to his former word. The moſt of the brethren of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> hauing fully, and moſt vnnaturally and wickedly determined to haue murdered him, for his dreames, and for his accuſing them to their father, were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding by the counſell of <hi>Reuben</hi> kept from that feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſinne, and ſo they ſold him by the aduice of <hi>Iudah:</hi> which afterward turned not onely to the great aduancement of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> according to his former dreames, but alſo to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of themſelues, and of their father, and of all their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in the time of famine: and to the accompliſhment of the former word of God, touching their ſoiourning in the land of <hi>Egypt: Geneſ.</hi> 37. 8, <hi>&amp;c. Dauid</hi> hauing (through the reliques of the old man in him) both fully intended, and alſo earneſtly proteſted, the vtter deſtruction of the houſe of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> (at leaſt of <hi>Nabal</hi> himſelfe, and all the males appertaining vnto him) by the gracious prouidence notwithſtanding of God in ſending <hi>Abigail</hi> to counſell and perſwade him to the contrary, was kept and reſtrained from the execution of that cruell and bloudy purpoſe: 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 32, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all theſe examples, as we ſee the ſpeciall priuilege of the children of God in being kept from ſuch hainous ſinnes, ſo by the two former examples we ſee alſo, that God turneth ſuch ſinnes as wherinto the righteous of infirmity doe fall, to their great good.</p>
               <p>The ſame point, viz. the preſeruing of the children of God from many great ſinnes, is alſo cleere by daily experience of theſe things that before wee ſpake of the ſobriety of Gods children in proſperity and in aduerſity: as alſo of that watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18428:103"/> which doth alwaies accompany and aſſociate the ſaid ſobriety.</p>
               <p>For whereas the wicked in proſperity ſwell and rage, are proud and inſolent; contemning and deſpiſing all men, as if they would beare down all before them, and ſo do fall into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit outrages; the children of God looking to him that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth proſperity, conſidering for what end they haue more then other; regarding the vncertainty of all that they haue; and remembring before the account that one day they ſhall make of the emploiment of all that they haue receiued, are kept from the former euils.</p>
               <p>So, whereas the wicked in aduerſity do mutter and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur againſt him that ſendeth the ſame; and particularly in the times of need and great penury, do occupy their heads with many wicked imaginations, and put in practiſe many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull ſhifts, of ſtealing, of borrowing without purpoſe of paying againe: of promiſing much and performing nothing: of deceiuing, coſening, and ſuch like: the children of God, liuing euen this life by their faith; and belieuing the promiſes of God, as well for this life, as for the life to come; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the performance of them in all ages; and calling to mind the experience that themſelues haue had of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, &amp;c. do ſo commit their waies vnto him, and caſt their care vpon him, that they are kept from thoſe former ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous euils. Theſe things might be proſecuted more at large, but the religious reader, by theſe inſtances may conſider of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like.</p>
               <p>Touching the other point before named (the raiſing againe of them that after regeneration doe fall to diſgracefull ſinnes) <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo is a moſt worthy example thereof. For how grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly he was raiſed after his foule adultery with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and his moſt horrible murder of her husband <hi>Vriiah,</hi> it is manifeſt by the confeſſion of his ſinne to <hi>Nathan</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13. and by that dolefull, and no leſſe heauy then heauenly one and fifty Pſalme, written afterward by him in further teſtimony of his moſt ſerious and vnſained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>When he was againe afterward ouertaken with numbring
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18428:103"/> of the people (yea, though <hi>Ioab</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelled him very grauely to the contrary) how was he raiſed out of the ſame, being admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed thereof by <hi>Nathan,</hi> and corrected with a great peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence amongſt his people by the angell of the Lord? Yea, did he he teſtifie that his riſing againe by acknowledgement of his ſinne, and by praying for the people that the hand of might be turned from them, vpon himſelfe and his own houſe, ſaying, <hi>I haue done wickedly: but theſe ſheepe what haue they done? Let thine hand I pray thee be againſt me and my fathers houſe:</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17.</p>
               <p>How did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> humble himſelfe, and cauſe the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Ieruſalem to humble themſelues, when hee ſaw <hi>wrath to come from the Lord vpon him and Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> becauſe he <hi>had not rendred vnto the Lord according to the reward</hi> (of health miraculouſly <hi>beſtowed vpon him? 2. Chroni.</hi> 32. 25. 26.</p>
               <p>How bitterly did Peter weepe after his foule and ſhamefull denying and forſwearing of his maſter? Yea how zealous was he from that time forward for him? For being with other, and Chriſt being there vnknown to his diſciples, and hauing bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them <hi>to caſt out their net on the right ſide of the ſhip,</hi> with promiſe to finde (for they had laboured all night and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken nothing) and the net (according to the former promiſe of Chriſt) hauing comprehended a great multitude of fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, whereby <hi>Iohn</hi> diſcerned him to be Chriſt that had ſo ſpoken vnto them, Peter no ſooner heard <hi>Iohn</hi> ſay, <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> but preſently he girded his garment vnto him, and leapt into the ſea, and ſo came ſwimming vnto Chriſt: whereas all the reſt ſtaied in the ſhip, and ſo at leiſure brought it, and came them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues therein vnto the land: <hi>Ioh,</hi> 21. 1.</p>
               <p>To theſe things let me heere inſert this one point more, <hi>viz.</hi> that whereas the children of God regenerated doe ſometimes fall into greater ſins, then the common ſort of eiuill men not regenerated (as <hi>Dauid</hi> in the things before ſpoken of, and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> in many things) this falleth out by the ſpeciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and wiſedome of God, the better to teach, what men are of themſelues without God, and beeing left vnto themſelues: as alſo to admoniſh ſuch <hi>as thinke they ſtand, to take heede
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18428:104"/> leſt they fall.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12. and to inſtruct all <hi>to finiſh ther ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with</hi> (the more) <hi>feare and trembling. Phill. p.</hi> 2. 12. So by their ſinnes, they are made ſchoolemaſters vnto other. Is not this a ſingular priuiledge, ſo to haue the old man more and more mortified? ſo to bee preſerued from great ſinnes after rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration? So to ariſe out of them, being by frailty, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall corruption fallen into them? and ſo by falling into them to bee made ſchoolemaſters of ſuch excellent things vnto other? Verily, we cannot but acknowledge it to be a great priuiledge, if we ſhall conſider with what greedineſſe all the wicked and vnregenerate commit ſinne, continue in ſinne, and like wilde horſes doe runne on, and proceed from one ſinne to another, without any reſtraint.</p>
               <p>But to proceed yet further, as the childrenof God do daily more and more die vnto ſinne, and are preſerued from noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious euils, wherein the wicked wallow and welter themſelues (like filthy ſwine in the mire, and will not be plucked out) or if they fall into ſuch euils, yet they riſe againe: As (I ſay) the children of God do thus, ſo alſo hauing by the vertue of their regeneration once brought foorth <hi>the fruits of the ſpirit and of righteouſneſſe,</hi> they are made more and more abundant in them.</p>
               <p>As the Apoſtle hath often exhorted the children of God ſo to doe, <hi>viz. to abound alwaies in the works of the Lord: 1. Cor. 15. 58. to encreaſe more and more, &amp;c. 1. Theſ. 4. 1. to bee rich in good works, &amp;c. 1. Tim. 6. 18. to conſider one another to prouoke to loue, and to doe good works: Heb. 10. 24. to toyne vertue with faith; and with vertue knowledge: with knowledge temperance: with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance patience: with patience godlineſſe: with godlines brotherly kindnes: with brotherly kindnes loue:</hi> and not onely to haue <hi>all theſe things, but that alſo theſe things ſhould abound in them: 2. Pet.</hi> 1. 6. 7. 8. And as the Apoſtle praied moſt earneſtly to be with the Philippians, to this end that <hi>their loue might abound more and more in knowledge and iudgement;</hi> and that to theſe ends, firſt that touching their inward man their minds might be able <hi>to iudge things that differ, and their hearts might be pure (as the Sunne: Cantic.</hi> 6. 9. that is, cleer and ſincere without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of hypocriſie) and touching their outward man, both,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18428:104"/> 
                  <hi>without offence euen till the comming of Chriſt,</hi> and alſo <hi>filled with the fruits of righteouſneſſe: Philip.</hi> 1. 9. 10. 11. As (I ſay) the Apoſtles haue exhorted the children of God ſo to abound in all goodneſſe (as alſo whiles they liued praied to bee with them for the ſame end) ſo it is not to bee doubted, but that then they did, and nowe daily do ſo: For they are the good ground into which the good ſeede of Gods word falling brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth foorth fruit, <hi>ſome an hundred folde, ſome ſixty folde, and ſome thirty folde: Mat.</hi> 13. 23. or as <hi>Marke</hi> ſetteth downe the words in a contrary order, <hi>one thirty, another ſixty, and ſome an hundred: Marke</hi> 4. 20. The which change of order is the more to bee obſerued, that neither they that bring forth <note place="margin">Note.</note> an hundred fold ſhould deſpiſe them that bring foorth but thirty folde: neither they that bring bring foorth but thirty ſhould be diſcouraged, becauſe they come ſhort of them that bring foorth an hundred fold. For though <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> ſet <hi>the hundred folde</hi> in the firſt place; and the <hi>thirty folde</hi> in the laſt place: yet <hi>Mark</hi> ſetteth the <hi>thirty folde</hi> in the firſt place, and the <hi>hundred f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld</hi> in the laſt place.</p>
               <p>Yea, to be thus more and more abundant in the fruits <hi>of the ſpirit and of righteouſneſſe,</hi> is that which our Sauiour hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>To him that hath ſhall bee giuen, and hee ſhall haue abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: Mat.</hi> 13. 12. and 25. 29. and again, <hi>I am the vine, and my father is the huſ bandman: euery branch that beareth not fruit in me, he takeeh away: and euery one that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit: Iohn.</hi> 15. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>The ſame is likewiſe taught by the two parables, <hi>Mat. 13. 31. &amp;c.</hi> wherein <hi>the kingdome of heauen</hi> is compared firſt <hi>to a graine of mustard. ſeed, that being the leaſt of all ſeeds groweth to a great tree:</hi> ſecondly <hi>to leuen, which beeing little</hi> (ſeaſoneth or) <hi>ſowreth an whole lump of dough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The end alſo of the miniſtery of the goſpell is not onelie that <hi>the Saints might bee gathered together,</hi> but alſo <hi>that they might grow vp into him, (viz.</hi> into Chriſt) <hi>which is the head, by whom euery member receineth encreaſe. Eph.</hi> 4, 12. 14. 15. The prophet likewiſe ſaith <hi>that the righteous ſhall flouriſh like a palme tree, and grow like the Cedars in Lebanon:</hi> and that <hi>they
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18428:105"/> that are planted in the houſe of God</hi> (that is, onely the children of God; <hi>for without are dogges: Reu.</hi> 22. 15.) <hi>ſhall flouriſh in the courts of God, and ſtill bring forth fruit in their age, and ſhall be fat and flouriſhing. Pſal.</hi> 92. 12. 13.</p>
               <p>Finally, <hi>the angel of the church of Thyatira</hi> is commended by our Sauiour, <hi>to haue had more works at the luſt, then at the firſt: Reuel.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>By all theſe arguments, who ſeeth not that it is a moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable thing, not onely to be ſo partaker of the death and reſurrection of Chriſt as firſt I ſaid; as likewiſe of many other graces, the leaſt whereof is more worth, then all the pearles, and treaſures, &amp; riches of the earth; but alſo to haue all the ſaid excellent graces euery day more and more encreaſed, in vs; and to abound in ſuch dainty and pleaſant fruits (as it were for Gods owne diet) as whereto the moſt excellent fruits of the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> at the firſt planting thereof by God himſelfe, were nothing comparable? For ſuch as the tree is, ſuch is the fruit: But the tree of theſe fruits being (as before wee heard) Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, is better then all the trees in the firſt gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Eden.</hi> Therefore the fruits of this tree (ſo planted (as it were) in the garden of our hearts) are like to the tree it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>That all the children of God do not alwaies thus thriue, proſper and beare fruit, it is either becauſe they doe not ſeeke it as they ought to doe: or that they doe not vſe ſuch meanes as they ſhould: or that they are not alike incorporated into Chriſt: or that they doe not alike beleeue the promiſe of God for the working and encreaſing of thoſe things in them, as hath beene ſaid they would: or for ſome other ſuch like cauſe.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point, all the former things ſo ſaid are yet the more, becauſe the children of God doe not only beare ſuch fruits, and that in great abundance, euery day more then before; but alſo that they doe it with great delight, and pleaſure. For ſo the man that is <hi>bleſſed</hi> is deſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> not onelie <hi>not to walke in the counſell of the wicked, or not to ſtand in the waie of ſinners, or not to ſitte in the ſeate of the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18428:105"/> ſcornefull,</hi> but alſo <hi>to haue his delight in the lawe of the Lord: Pſalme</hi> 1. 1. 2. What? In the reading of it onely? or only in the ſtudy of it, becauſe it followeth that <hi>he meditateth therein day and night?</hi> Not ſo: but alſo in the practiſe and obedience of it. This is manifeſt, firſt by the oppoſition of this branch to the former <hi>of walking in the way of the wicked.</hi> Secondly by that which followeth in verſe 3. <hi>viz. that he is like the tree planted by the riuers of waters, that bringeth forth</hi> (not leaues but) <hi>her fruit in due ſeaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>The fear of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>great delight</hi> (not in the hiſtories, nor in the eloquent phraſes and ſentences of the Scripture, <note place="margin">Note.</note> which beeing more excellent then all other hiſtories &amp; elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whatſoeuer, may and will delight a carnall man, but) <hi>in the commandements of the Lord,</hi> are ioyned together, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in the man that <hi>is bleſſed: Pſal.</hi> 112. 1.</p>
               <p>This is further euident by the example of <hi>Dauid, who reioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced when they ſaid vnto him, wee will goe to the houſe of the Lord. Pſal.</hi> 122. 1. If he reioyced to ſee other forward in going to the houſe of the Lord, did he not much more reioice to ſee them bring forth the fruit (and that plentifully) of their going to the houſe of the Lord? And if he reioyced to ſee other ſo to doe, ſhall we thinke that himſelfe did not much more cheerfullie and gladly do the workes of God? yea, we ſee that he did. For how did he ioy in the bringing home of the Arke? Yea, is it not ſayd that <hi>he danced with all his might before the Lord?</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
               <p>How glad alſo was he, and how did hee reioice and bleſſe God when <hi>Abigail</hi> met him, and perſwaded him to change his mind, and to reuoke his former vowe againſt <hi>Nabal?</hi> How (I ſay) did he then reioyce, and bleſſe God ſaying; <hi>Bleſſed bee the Lord God of Iſrael, that ſent thee out this day to meete mee: And bleſſed be thy counſell, and bleſſed bee thou, which haſt kept me this day from comming to ſhed bloud.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 32. If he ſo reioyced for being kept from ſo great a ſinne, wee may well thinke that he much more reioyced in an higher degree of ſanctification, viz. in bearing the fruits of godlines aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly euery day more then other?</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:18428:106"/>
               <p>Such liberty haue all the children of God, as that they are not only freed from the bondage of ſinne, and do bring forth the fruits of the ſpirit and of righteouſneſſe, but that alſo they do this with great delight and ioy: O ſweet ſtate! O ſingular priuiledge! O honorable condition!</p>
               <p>The wicked indeed make great mirth. They laugh and ſhout in the midſt of their wickedneſſe, that all the place where they are, rings of them. But (alas miſerable men) this is but painted ioy: <hi>It is but like the cracking of thornes, &amp;c.</hi> But of this more afterward. And againe, as touching ioy in any good thing, they are ſo far from it, that to heare any thing that way is a death vnto them: yea, when they are vrged by chriſtian au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to do any thing that good is, they do it ſo againſt the haire, ſo murmuringly, ſo grudgingly, with ſuch griefe, moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and fretting, that their ſaid worke is altogether abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the ſight of God. For if God <hi>loueth a cheerefull giuer</hi> or doer of any thing: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. then he muſt needs hate and abhor him that giueth or doeth any thing vnwillingly, and grudgingly. Thus much for this matter.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the next place let vs conſider the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the children of God by the word and Sacraments. The word indeed ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be common to the wicked and to Gods children. Notwithſtanding it is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall to ſaluation only in the children of God. <hi>If our Goſpell be hid</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>it is hid to them that periſh:</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. As whatſoeuer euill we haue, we haue it by <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo whatſoeuer good we haue, we haue it by Chriſt.

They therefore that haue not Chriſt, cannot claime any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the word, or any intereſt into the word.</p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:18428:106"/>
               <p>Now although the word be the meanes of dying more and more vnto ſinne, as alſo of growing more and more <hi>in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue ſpoken of the word before, as of that mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, whereby God beginneth our regeneration at the firſt, and becauſe that before ſpoken in that behalfe may be vnderſtood of the word as a meanes of the things handled in the laſt former Chapter, therefore I will not ſo ſpeake of it here: but in other conſiderations, viz. firſt as it is a perfect rule of faith and manners, containing all things neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, either to be known and beleeued, or to be done and practiſed. Secondly, as it is a principall part of that chriſtian armor, whereby the children of God are to defend themſelues againſt the enemies of their ſaluation. Thirdly, as it is their ſpecialleſt conſolation and comfort in any affliction.</p>
               <p>Concerning the word, as it is a rule of faith, and of life or manners, two things are to be noted: firſt the perfection of it, ſecondly the perpetuity of it.</p>
               <p>The perfection thereof is expreſly commended, and prooued by diuers effects: viz. <hi>the conuerſion of the ſoule, the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wiſedome to the ſimple &amp;c.

It is ſaid to be <hi>the power of God to ſaluation: Rom.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>to be able to ſaue the ſoule: Iames</hi> 1. 21. And leſt theſe things ſhould be miſtaken, as ſpoken partly of the word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and partly of a word vnwritten, deliuered by tradition from hand to hand (as the Papiſts vrge) and that the word on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written were not ſo perfect or powerfull, therefore the very <hi>Scriptures</hi> (that is, the word only written) are ſaid, <hi>to be able to make a man wiſe to ſaluation: and to make the man of God perfect vnto euery good worke: 2. Tim.</hi> 3. 15. 16. 17. If the man of God (that is, the miniſter of the word, ſo often times called for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies ſake) then euery child of God els. For no child of God is bound to know, to beleeue or practiſe more towards ſaluation, then the miniſter of God is bound to teach. Yea, whatſoeuer is vrged more for ſaluation, is abomination.</p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:18428:107"/>
               <p>It is further ſaid, that thoſe things that are before written, <hi>are written that we might beleeue that Ieſus is the Chriſt, the ſonne of God, and that beleeuing they might haue life through his name: Ioh.</hi> 20. 31. God giueth vs this faith and life by the ſcriptures, and let the Papiſts take any thing els by their vnwritten veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and traditions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> repeateth this twice, <hi>If wee, or an Angell from heauen ſhould preach vnto you otherwiſe, then that which we haue preached vnto you, let him be accurſed: Galat.</hi> 1. 8. 9. But <hi>Paul</hi> preached or <hi>ſaid no other things, then thoſe which the Prophets and Moſes did ſay ſhould come: Acts.</hi> 26. 22. and he preached no other Goſpell then <hi>that which God had promiſed before by his Prophets in the holy Scriptures: Rom.</hi> 1. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>So perfect is the word of God, that when the learnedſt man in the world by long ſtudy of any one ſentence, hath ſpoken all that he can, yet another may come after, and adde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which the former neuer ſpake nor vnderſtood concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that place.</p>
               <p>It is like a bottomleſſe well, that will neuer be drawn drie: yea, like the ſea it ſelfe, that will neuer be emptied. As the Prophet ſpeaketh of <hi>the righteouſneſſe and iudgements of God, Thy righteouſneſſe is like the mighty mountaines, and thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments like a great deep: Pſal.</hi> 36. 6. ſo may it be ſaid of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for the height and depth of them.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle by exclamation ſpeaketh thus of <hi>the wiſdome, knowledge, iudgement, and the way of God; O the deepneſſe of the riches both of the wiſedome, and knowledge of God! How vnſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are his iudgements, and his waies past finding out! Rom.</hi> 11. 33. May not this be ſpoken of the word of God? Where is that <hi>wiſedome and knowledge of God?</hi> Where are thoſe <hi>his iudgements and waies</hi> declared but in the word? All the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of all men in the world are but ſhallow in reſpect of the word of God. All the books in the world not handling the word of God and doctrine thereof, do not containe ſo much and deep matter, as is in one of the leaſt canonicall Epiſtles. An heathen man meeting with the Goſpell written by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and reading but the firſt verſe thereof, could ſay, that <hi>that rude fellow</hi> (ſo rudely he termed the Apoſtle) <hi>had comprehended
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18428:107"/> more matter in that one ſentence, then was in all the bookes of all Philoſophers.</hi> How much matter then is contained in that whole Goſpell? Eſpecially in all the Scriptures? All other books whatſoeuer, are ſo much more excellent, the more they agree with, and the neerer they come to the word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in holy ſcriptures. How excellent then is the ſaid word of God it ſelfe?</p>
               <p>When all the chiefe wiſe men of a kingdom furniſhed with the knowledge of all former lawes of the ſame kingdom, and well inſtructed likewiſe in the word of God, doe meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make new lawes for that kingdome, yet after conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one with another, and after many daies conferring their readings and iudgements one with another, the lawes that they make will not be ſo perfect, but that either ſomething might haue been added, or ſomething might haue been left out. But the word of God is ſo abſolute and complete, that as nothing therein is ſuperfluous, ſo nothing is wanting vnto it. What a ſingular priuledge then haue the children of God, that haue the benefit of this law?</p>
               <p>To lay forth the perfection of Gods word yet a little more fully, and to make the ſame ſomwhat more euideut: let vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it to be ſo perfect for matters of faith and knowledge vnto ſaluation, that whatſoeuer is not agreeable thereunto is to be held as erroneous.</p>
               <p>Touching manners, life and conuerſation, it teacheth all duties to God and men; euen to all ſorts of men, ſuperiors, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors, equals, friends, and foes: and in euery ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: viz. what to doe for them or to them, in ſickneſſe or health: in pouerty or wealth: in liberty or in priſon: being ioyfull or mourning: dwelling far off or nigh vnto vs: being of the ſame nation or of another: kinsfolk or ſtrangers: friends or aduerſaries: within our family, or without: widowes or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, or in any other ſtate whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>As it directeth vs how to carry ourſelues towards al of what condition ſoeuer, and in what ſtate ſoeuer they be, ſo it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth our behauiour at all times, and in all places: in the day and in the night, when we eat, when we drink, when we labour, when we reſt, when we walke, when we lye, when wee ſleepe, in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18428:108"/> the winter and in the ſummer, publikely and priuately, at home and abroad: in our ſecret chambers, and when wee are with company in the time of peace, and in the time of warre.</p>
               <p>It hath rules likewiſe for our ſelues in reſpect of our ſelues, what to do in proſperity, in aduerſitie: when wee are children, when we are men, and when we are old: touching meate, drinke, apparell, ſleepe, and the vſe of all other things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or not indifferent: for this life, and for the life to come.</p>
               <p>Whereas alſo the lawes of men, reach only to the outward man, to reſtrain the ſame from euill, and to bind it to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of good: the lawes of God are giuen for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not onely of the outward man, but alſo of the inward: not onely of the body, but alſo of the ſoule, euen of our mind, vnderſtanding, memorie, thoughts, and all affections.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe no member of the body but that in the word of God there is direction for it: for the eye to ſee: for the eare to heare: for the noſtrell to ſmell &amp;c. But of theſe things before in Chap. 11. where for further ſight of theſe things, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the learned reader to the Treatiſe of <hi>Otho Caſmannus</hi> in his anatomy of a ſpirituall man.</p>
               <p>By theſe things thus pointed at touching the perfection of the word of God, we may the better ſee the priuiledge of the children of God to bee ſuch by the word of God, that they need neuer to bee to ſeeke further for direction in anything concerning ſaluation then only to the word. This briefly ſhall ſuffice for the perfection of the word of God.</p>
               <p>Touching the perpetuity of the word, it is teſtified in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of the Scripture. <hi>The feare of the Lord</hi> (that is, the word which teacheth and worketh the feare of the Lord) <hi>is cleane, and endureth for euer. Pſal.</hi> 19. 9. and againe, <hi>O Lord thy word endureth for euer in the heauens Pſal.</hi> 119. 89. Another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith. <hi>The graſſe withereth, and the flower fadeth: but the word of God ſhall ſtand for euer Iſai.</hi> 40. 8. Our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Heauen and earth ſhall paſſe away, but my words ſhall not paſſe. Mat.</hi> 24. 35. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 17. <hi>Luk</hi> 21. 33.</p>
               <p>This is manifeſt by experience. For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas the word of God hath continually had both more aduerſaries in number,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18428:108"/> as alſo greater for power, as ſome Emperors; and for malice, as the hereticks, eſpecially the Papiſts, then all other bookes whatſoeuer: the one ſort of ſuch enimies, ſeeking vtterly to extinguiſh the word; and the other endeauouring to corrupt the very text it ſelfe: yet al other writings haue beene mangled and ſome bookes haue vtterly periſhed: but the Lord hath alwaies preſerued the Scriptures from deſtruction on the one ſide, and from corruption on the other ſide. As the ſouldiers that brake the bones of the two theeues that were crucified with our Sauiour, had no power for all that to breake any bones of our Sauiour himſelfe: ſo they that haue either conſumed or corrupted other bookes, haue neuer had the power, either to deſtroy, or corrupt the ſcripture touching the originall text thereof. The Lord hath alwaies moſt migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily preſerued ſome copies both inuiolate, and alſo vndefiled. Yea the papiſts that at their pleaſure haue mangled &amp; clipt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, and corrupted all the writings and bookes of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers, taking out of them what they haue thought in them preiudiciall to their damnable hereſies (as appeareth in <hi>Index expurgatorius;</hi> their dealing in that behalfe may be called <hi>Ignis expurgatorius)</hi> haue notwithſtanding neuer had power to laye ſuch violent hand, vpon the originall text of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>This perpetuity of the Scripture is not onely to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the very letter and word thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo of the ſenſe and meaning. Euery ſentence of the ſcripture is not onely the ſame in letters and words that was at the firſt; but alſo in ſenſe <note place="margin">Note.</note> and meaning. No ſcripture, no ſentence of ſcripture hath any other meaning now, then it had at the firſt giuing thereof by inſpiration from God.</p>
               <p>As God himſelfe is immutable, ſo likewiſe the will of God reuealed in his word is vnchangeable. Therefore the word is one of the <hi>two immutable things, wherby we may haue ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation Heb.</hi> 6. 16. As no man may adde any thing to the words themſelues, nor take ought from them: ſo no man may alter or change any thing touching the ſenſe &amp; meaning of them. The letters and words of the ſcriptures are but as the bodie thereof: the ſenſe and meaning are as the life and ſoule of it.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18428:109"/> If therefore no man may encreaſe or diminiſh any thing of the former, much leſſe may any alter or change any thing in the latter. The Lord that hath forbidden the maiming of a man in any limme, hath much more forbidden the hurt of him in his life. The like is to be ſayd of the word of God.</p>
               <p>This then is a great difference, of the word of God from the lawes of men. For though the lawes of men doe remaine the ſame touching the letter of them: yet oft times the ſenſe and meaning of them is changed, as times and Iudges are cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And therefore it is a common ſaying, that the law reſteth <hi>in pectore Iudicis, in the Iudges breaſt:</hi> and ſo one thing is law one yeere, and the cleane contrary is lawe another. But the word of God being no more variable in ſenſe then in words, but alwaies is conſtant as God himſelfe is alwaies the ſame, is ſo much the more excellent. Therefore alſo the dignity of the children of God that haue this word for their conſtant rule, both of their faith and of their manners, is ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For if once they haue the true ſenſe of any part of the word, they haue it for euer.</p>
               <p>I might heere ſpeake of a third perpetuity beſides the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer two of the letter and of the ſenſe: <hi>viz.</hi> touching the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy thereof in whomſoeuer it taketh roote downward, to bring foorth fruit vpward. For in ſuch it neuer dieth, but abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the eternall life of them in whom it is ſo effectual and powerfull. For ſuch are ſaid <hi>to fulfill the word of God, and to abide for euer.</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 17. Their ſoules in death it ſelfe liue with God in heauen: and though their bodies conſume for a time, yet they periſh not, but ſhall be raiſed vp againe at the laſt day, and be made like vnto the glorious body of Chriſt (as afterward we ſhall heare) <hi>Phil</hi> 3. 21. and ſo God continueth their God as well in death as in life: in which reſpect it is ſaid, that <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing. Marke</hi> 12. 27. But becauſe by many occaſions in many places of this treatiſe, I fall into mention of this point; therefore heere it ſhall be enough thus only to haue named it. Thus much for the perpetuity of Gods word, and ſo alſo for the firſt thing touching the word in this place, viz. as it is a rule of faith and manners.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the ſecond conſideration of the word in this
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18428:109"/> place, namely as it is a part of the armor of God, whereby we are to defend our ſelues againſt the enemies of our ſaluation. Touching this, it is called <hi>the ſword of the Spirit: Epheſ.</hi> 6. 17. yea we are to obſerue, that in that place it hath not onely a ſingle place, but a double in the chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> armor there preſcribed. For the Apoſtle doth not only generally bid them to take <hi>the ſword of the ſpirit, which is the word of God,</hi> but alſo more particularly he doth will them in <hi>verſe</hi> 15. <hi>that their feete ſhould bee ſhod with the preparation of the goſpell of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is the word of God one part, or two parts onely of the ſpiritual armor wherby we are to defend our ſelues againſt our ſpiritual enemies: but alſo (in a manner) our whole chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> armor; or at leaſt the armory and ſtorehouſe out of which all the other parts of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> armor are to be had: yea, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall meanes alſo whereby they are to bee obtained. For from whence, or by what means are we to haue <hi>the girdle of truth, the breſt-plate of righteouſnes, the ſhoes of the goſpel of peace, the ſhield of faith, the helmet of ſaluation:</hi> from whence (I ſay) or by what meanes are we to haue all theſe, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; by the word of God? Therfore it ſeemeth that the Apoſtle did of ſpecial purpoſe ſet <note place="margin">Note.</note> that in the laſt place, as the meanes &amp; fountaine of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>By the word (as there the Apoſtle calleth it the ſword of the ſpirit) we are to vnderſtand all ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of Scripture touching doctrine, all commandements of God negatiue againſt euill, &amp; affirmatiue for that which is good: all promiſes of bleſſings, and all threatnings of iudgements, and all examples both of ſuch ſinnes as are forbidden, with the execution of Gods iudgements vpon ſuch as haue committed them: and alſo of all vertues, with the performance of Gods promiſes vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>We are alſo further to obſerue, that the word is called <hi>the ſword of the ſpirit,</hi> not only becauſe <hi>the word was firſt giuen by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God:</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. and <hi>holy men ſpake as they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the holy ghoſt:</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. and <hi>the Prophets ſearched when and at what time the fore-witneſſing ſpirit of Chriſt in them, ſhould declare the things that are now ſhewed, &amp;c.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. but alſo becauſe we know not how to vſe this ſword, but by direction of the ſpirit: neither hath this ſword any ſharpnes for defence of our ſelues and wounding of our aduerſaries, except it bee
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18428:110"/> accompanied (and as it were edged) by the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>This ſword was ſo vſed by <hi>Steuen,</hi> againſt his aduerſaries, <hi>that they were not able to reſiſt the wiſedome and the ſpirit, by the which he ſpake: Acts</hi> 6. 10.</p>
               <p>By this ſword <hi>Peter</hi> defended himſelfe and other that ſpake ſtrange tongues, againſt them that maliciouſly ſaid, <hi>They were full of new wine: Acts</hi> 2. 14. 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this ſword <hi>Apollo mightily confuted the Iewes publikely, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Scriptures that Ieſus was the Chriſt: Acts</hi> 18. 28.</p>
               <p>By this ſword Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, defended himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the diuell himſelfe, and at laſt put him to flight, repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all his aſſaults with this weapon, <hi>It is written, Man ſhall not liue by bread onely, &amp;c. It is written, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God, &amp;c. It is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerue: Mat.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt could haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled Satan by his ſecret power, but he did it rather by his <note place="margin">Note.</note> word, to commend his word in like caſes againſt all his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults. <hi>He could haue put him to flight without</hi> any anſwer at the firſt: but he ſuffered him to aſſault him diuers waies, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered all by, <hi>It is written,</hi> to teach vs likewiſe by the ſame weapon to defend our ſelues, not againſt ſome, but againſt all tentations.</p>
               <p>This then is the priuiledge of all the children of God, that though they haue many and mighty aduerſaries, yet they haue alwaies armour ſufficient, ſufficiently to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt them all. If at any time they receiue any hurt, it is either becauſe they draw not forth this ſword of the Spirit, or becauſe they doe not rightly vſe it. Neither is this word only a ſword to defend them, but alſo a ſalue to cure them, if by neglect thereof at any time, or by not vſing it rightly, they receiue any wound. What was the cauſe of the death (I meane of the ſpirituall death) of our firſt parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue?</hi> Becauſe they drew not out the ſword of Gods word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Serpent as they ſhould haue done. Whereby were they cured and reſtored to life againe? By the voice of God calling and (as it were) crying after them, when they fled &amp; hid themſelues from him.</p>
               <p>What was the cauſe of the grieuous wound that <hi>Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18428:110"/> in the high Prieſts hall, a thouſand times greater then that which before he had giuen to the high Prieſts ſeruant in cutting off his eare? was it not becauſe he had forgotten the former word of Chriſt, admoniſhing him thereof? verily it was: and therefore the remembrance of it afterward, was that whereby he was healed of that wound: <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 75. What was the cauſe why the angell of the Church of Sardi, was ſo woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that though he had a name to be aliue, yet hee was dead, that is, ready to die, and at the point of death? Euen becauſe he had let go his hold of the ſword of the ſpirit. Therfore for curing of his ſaid wound, our Sauiour biddeth him <hi>to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how he had receiued and heard, &amp; to hold faſt, &amp;c. Reuel.</hi> 3. 2. 3. the like may be ſaid of all wounds of any other of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God at any time.</p>
               <p>Thus the children of God muſt vſe the word of God, viz. not as a thing to play or ſport with, or whereof to make ieſts <note place="margin">Note.</note> for the mirth of other: but as a weapon, and as a ſword to fight with: yea, thus they will vſe it, that are indeede the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. If at any time they be prouoked by other, or by their owne hearts, to diſtruſt Gods prouidence, they will defend themſelues by many precepts for <hi>truſting in the Lord: Pſal.</hi> 37. 3. and 62. 8. and for <hi>caſting their care vpon God: Pſal.</hi> 37. 5. and 52. 22. and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 6. and by ſuch ſentences of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as pronounce him <hi>bleſſed that truſteth in the Lord: Pſalm.</hi> 40. 4. and 84. 5. and 12. by many promiſes to them that ſo do, annexed expreſly (for the moſt part) to the former comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: by the iudgements of God vpon ſuch as haue mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured againſt God: <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 1. vpon ſuch as haue doubted of Gods promiſes: as vpon the noble man of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that would not beleeue the Prophet, in the name of the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying of great plenty the next day: 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 2. and 20. yea vpon <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe for his diſtruſt: <hi>Num.</hi> 20. 12. and 27. 14. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 50. 51. and laſtly, by the prouidence of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the widow of <hi>Zarepta</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Elijah:</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 6. and 8. &amp;c. and towards a widdowe of one of the ſonnes of the prophets: 2. <hi>Kings.</hi> 4 1. &amp;c. and towards many thouſands that following our Sauiour for foode of their ſoules, were fed likewiſe abundantly and miraculouſly with corporall foode:

               <p>When they are moued to pride, they can call to mind the manifold precepts and ſentences againſt it: <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 4. <hi>Pro.</hi> 6. 17. and 16. 5. <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 6. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5. ſo alſo the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> with <hi>Sancherib,</hi> and the iudgements of God not onely vpon them, but alſo vpon <hi>Vzzia</hi> King of <hi>Iuda</hi> for preſuming to meddle with the Prieſts office, in offering of ſacrifice: 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 20. and vpon <hi>Dauid</hi> for numbring the people in a kind of pride: 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Hezekiah</hi> for hauing <hi>his heart lifted vp</hi> after the recouery of his health: 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 25. &amp;c.

That that hath been ſaid of the priuiledge of the children of God <hi>by the ſword of the Spirit the word of God,</hi> for their defence againſt the former tentations, may be ſaid tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching other tentations alſo vnto other ſinnes.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid concerning errors and hereſies. Let vs take a ſhort view of ſome of the popiſh hereſies, whereunto ſo many Ieſuits, and other Romiſh croaking frogs, in euery citie, towne, village, and (almoſt) family, doe now ſo buſily perſwade all ſtates and degrees of men, women, &amp; children, and whereof great multitudes of euery ſtate, ſex, &amp; age, are as apprehenſiue (becauſe they haue not beleeued the truth of the Goſpell thus long preached vnto them, but <hi>haue had pleaſure in vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe:</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 12) as the Iewes were mad vpon ſacrificing to the hoſt of heauen: <hi>Ierem.</hi> 7. 18. and as any children are to ſee plaies, goodly ſhewes, and other ſuch vanities.</p>
               <p>Do ſuch frogs therefore and Romiſh ſerpents perſwade that none can know the ſcriptures to be of God, but by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church? Againſt this the children of God may defend themſelues by theſe arguments out of the word. Firſt, that the Church hath no authority aboue the ſcriptures, and that the ſcriptures take no authority from the Church: Firſt, becauſe the Church being a company of men, therefore as <hi>Chriſt himſelfe receiueth not the record of man</hi> (though as good as <hi>Iohn Baptiſt) Iohn</hi> 5. 34. ſo neither doth the Scripture. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe the word being without error, and teaching that all men are ſubiect to error, it cannot therefore receiue authority from them, much leſſe be ſubiect vnto them. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe <hi>the Scripture is the teſtimonie of God, and the teſtimony of God is greater then the teſtimonie of man:</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 9. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the Church hauing all her authority from the word (for how ſhall the Church proue that ſhe hath any authority but by the word?) the word cannot haue any from the Church. Fiftlie, becauſe the Church is none of the witneſſes
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18428:114"/> reckoned: 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 7. 8. Sixtly, becauſe they that will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the ſcriptures, will neither beleeue one raiſed from the dead: <hi>Luk</hi> 16. 31. nor Chriſt himſelfe if hee were here to ſpeake perſonallie vnto them: <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 47. How then will they beleeue the Church, that will not belieue the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
               <p>Secondly, the children of God haue this to plead againſt the former hereſie: viz. that many other things doe witneſſe the ſcriptures to be of God: though the Church ſhould not only be ſilent in that behalfe, but alſo vtterly deny the ſame. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firſt of all the <hi>ſpirit of God</hi> (whereby they are ſealed, <hi>and crie Abba father) which ſearcheth all things, euen the deepe things of God;</hi> ſo that as <hi>no man knoweth the things of a man, but the ſpirit of a man which is in him; ſo no man knoweth the things of God, but the ſpirit of God:</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. 11. If no man know the things of God, but the ſpirit of God, how can any man know the ſcriptures themſelues but by the ſpirit of God? For where are <hi>the things of God</hi> but in the Scripture? How alſo can any man not know the Scriptures to be of God, that hath the ſpirit of God?</p>
               <p>Secondly, the children of God know the ſcriptures to be of God by the pure and holy matter of the ſcriptures agreeable to the nature of God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by the diſagreement of the ſcriptures to the nature of man, condemning whatſoeuer commeth from the ſame, the children of God vnderſtand the ſcriptures not to be of man, and therefore conſequently of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by the excellent harmony of all the ſcripture, and by the perpetuall euen threed of truth ſpunne thorowout them, without any knot of vntruth, from the beginning to the ending.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, they know the ſame by the diuine ſtile and phraſe of the ſcripture, ſauoring altogether of God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, by the iuſt accompliſhment of all things foretold in the ſcripture, and that in the manner and time therein alſo mentioned.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly by the mighty effects of the word at the preaching thereof in the hearts both of the elect and alſo of ſome repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:18428:114"/> it is the more euident to come from the mighty God. In <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 11. in the people that heard our Sauiour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 28. euen in the meſſengers of the Prieſts and Phariſies ſent to apprehend him: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 46. in the great multitude that heard <hi>Peter</hi> preach: <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. in <hi>Felix</hi> hearing <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 24. 25. and in the daily hearers of the word ſincerely preached, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>as a ſauor of life vnto life: or as the ſauour of death vnto death:</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
               <p>Eightly by the perpetuity of the ſcriptures (before ſpoken of) in deſpight of all the enemies thereof.</p>
               <p>Ninthly by the old and new iudgements of God vpon all the contemners thereof: and by the old and new mercies of God vpon the profeſſors of it.</p>
               <p>If ſuch Romiſh frogs and ſerpents before mentioned, vrge the Apocrypha books to be canonicall and diuine ſcripture, the children of God may draw out the ſword of the word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that error: <hi>Luke</hi> 1 70. and 16. 39: and 24. 27. where it is euident that all the old Teſtament is written by Prophets, and that therefore the Apocrypha books being no part of the new teſtament, are not alſo any part of the old, as not hauing been written by any Prophets.</p>
               <p>Secondly they may obiect againſt the former error, that the whole old teſtament was giuen to the Iewes: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1. 2. and that therefore the Apocrypha books are no part thereof, as the which were neuer giuen to the Iewes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were neuer written in the Iewes language.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they may wound the former error by the attribute, truth, often giuen to the word of God: <hi>Pſal:</hi> 19. 10. and 119. 142. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 17. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Coloſſ</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 18. ſith that in euery Apocrypha booke, there is ſome repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the Scripture, and ſome of them doe diſagree with themſelues.</p>
               <p>If any do demand why the new teſtament was not written in the Iewes language, as well as the old teſtament, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God may eaſily anſwer, the reaſon to haue been dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Firſt becauſe the time of the Iewes caſting off, and cutting off from beeing a people for a time, being at hand, when the new teſtament beganne to be written, there was no

                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:18428:116"/> cauſe why it ſhould be written in their tongue. Secondly, the time being alſo come of tranſlating the kingdome of God from them to other nations, yea to all nations, there was the greater reaſon, why the Scriptures of the new Teſtament ſhold be written in that tongue that was moſt common; eſpecially that was the tongue of that nation, where the Lord purpoſed firſt to plant his Church, after the reiection of the Iewes. The Greeks being that people, it was therefore moſt fit, that is ſhould be written in that tongue.</p>
               <p>If any doe further reply, that I take that for granted, which may well be doubted of, viz. that the apocrypha books are no part of the newe teſtament: I do anſwer, that this cannot bee ſo much as doubted, but to affirme it muſt be held a great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie: for as much as there is no mention at all in any of them of Chriſt manifeſted in the fleſh, either conceiued, or borne, or put to death, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Againſt the defect and inſufficiency of the Scriptures pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Papiſts for the iuſtifying and ſtabliſhing of their traditions, both all before ſpoken of the perfection of the word may be oppoſed: &amp; alſo our Sauiours owne ſentence againſt humane traditions, though not altogether repugnant to the Scriptures, but rather hauing ſome affinitie with them: <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. and <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. To the imagined difficulty of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the children of God may oppoſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the word is the word of him <hi>that is light it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>that the law is ſayd to giue wiſedome to the ſimple, &amp; light to the eyes: Pſal.</hi> 119. 7. and that <hi>the word is a lanthorne to our feet, and a light vnto our paths: Pſal.</hi> 119. 105. and <hi>Prou.</hi> 6. 23.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that <hi>wiſedome</hi> ſaith <hi>that all her words are plaine to them that will vnderſtand, and ſtraight to them that would finde knowledge: Pro.</hi> 8. 9. and, <hi>that knowledge is eaſie to him that will vnderſtand. Pro.</hi> 14. 6. and:</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that if the <hi>Scripture be ſufficient,</hi> or <hi>profitable to teach, to conuince, to correct and to inſtruct in righteonſneſſe:</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. then they be not obſcure, for no obſcure writings are profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for ſuch ends.</p>
               <p>The ſame place alſo laſt before mentioned, prooueth that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:18428:116"/> the Scriptures ought to be interpreted by themſelues, and are ſufficient for interpretation of themſelues, by the help of the Spirit whereby they were giuen. For if they be able to make <hi>men wiſe to ſaluation:</hi> and if they be able <hi>to make the man of God abſolute to euery good worke:</hi> then are they ſufficient for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of themſelues, and for bringing of men to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them. For how ſhall men be wiſe that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not what <hi>the will of the Lord</hi> is? (as before we heard) <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 17. And how ſhall the man of God bee abſolute to euerie good worke, if he be not able to interpret the Scripture? Is not interpretation of the Scripture one good worke of the man of God? Yea, is it not the moſt principall? what other worke can be performed without it?</p>
               <p>The doctrine of particular election of ſome vnto ſaluation being denied by the Papiſts, the children of God may defend it by the word of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt by the particular election of <hi>Iaakob,</hi> and of the Lady to whom <hi>Iohn</hi> did write his ſecond Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>Secondly by the words of Chriſt, <hi>I know whom I haue choſen: Iohn</hi> 13. 18.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by the like phraſe of the Apoſtle: <hi>The Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who are his:</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by the <hi>phraſe of writing names in heauen: Luk.</hi> 10. 20 Election by <hi>the free grace of God,</hi> without any reſpect of our works, may be defended by the word of God, as before, vpon other occaſion, it hath beene ſhewed.</p>
               <p>That the election of God cannot be nullified, or fruſtrated, as the Papiſts doe teach, the children of God may iuſtifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them by the word of God: <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 37. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24. and by many other things alledged in this treatiſe.</p>
               <p>That there is but one Mediator, againſt the plurality of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators blaſphemouſly taught by the Papiſts, is to bee defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the word of God: 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Againſt iuſtification by works wholly or in part mainteined by the papiſts, the children of God haue the word of God: <hi>Rom</hi> 3 28 <hi>Gala.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>&amp;c Philip.</hi>

                  </gap>. 9. Secondly, that as Chriſt was condemned without any euill of his own, only by impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ation of our ſinne vnto him; ſo we are iuſtified without any righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:18428:117"/> of our own, only by imputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his righteouſneſſe actiue and paſſiue vnto vs. Thirdly, that all our works being condemned in ſcripture as vnperfect, are therefore excluded from iuſtification of vs before God, who being himſelfe moſt perfect can accept of nothing, but that which is likewiſe fully perfect &amp; abſolute like vnto himſelfe. Fourthly that all men owe more to God (as hath been before ſhewed) then they are able to pay: yea, euen he that oweth leaſt: <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 41. 42. and that therefore no man is able by anie workes whatſoeuer, to purchaſe any new benefits at the hands of God. Fiftly, that Chriſt hauing ſatiſfied for all our ſinnes (as hath been before prooued) there are none left to vs to make ſatiſfaction for.</p>
               <p>Touching the Sacraments, whereas the papiſts proclaime matrimony to be one, we defend our deniall thereof. Firſt, becauſe God hath inſtituted no Sacramental ſigne for matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. Secondly, all Sacraments are proper to the church: but mariage is as well for them that are without the church, as for them that are within it. Thirdly, that whereas Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all ſorts of members of the church, the Papiſts themſelues deny matrimony to belong to their moſt holy order of Prieſthood. Fourthly, that Sacraments are inſtituted for confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our faith in Chriſt: but that matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was inſtituted whiles <hi>Adam</hi> was perfect, not belieuing in Chriſt before his fall, neither ſtanding in need of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The like we plead againſt their other ſuppoſed Sacraments beſides baptiſme and the ſupper of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Touching baptiſm, wheras we deny againſt them baptiſm to take away originall ſinne, we defend our ſelues in this behalfe by the word of God, viz. by the example of <hi>Dauid</hi> in his age acknowledging his originall ſinne: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. and of <hi>Paul</hi> complaining of his like ſinne: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony alſo of <hi>Iames:</hi> Chap. 1. 13. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Whereas we further deny againſt them, baptiſm to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to ſaluation, we defend our ſelues in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe by the word. Firſt, becauſe circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being the ſame in ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; vſe that baptiſm is, was intermitted for 40. yeers in the wildernes. 2. Becauſe the children of the faithful as ſoon as they are born, and before baptiſm, are within the Couenant. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14.</p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:18428:117"/>
               <p>Touching the ſupper of the Lord, whereas they take away the cup from the people, we oppoſe: Firſt the inſtitution in both kinds. Secondly the words of the Apoſtle according to the inſtitution, mentioning the cup as well as the bread: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly the continuall practiſe of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Their tranſubſtantiation &amp; feined changing of the eſſence of the elements in the ſaid ſupper we confute. Firſt, by the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them by Chriſt himſelf to his diſciples, he going after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into the garden, and ſuffering vpon the croſſe: which he could not haue done, if he had giuen himſelfe to his diſciples before: &amp; if they had eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him before, eſpecially he being then not glorified. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, by the end of the ſupper, viz. <hi>the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt being preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, what need of reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance? Remembrance is of things abſent. Thirdly, the continuance of Chriſt in heauen til the end of the world: <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. Fourthly, the nature of a Sacrament, requiring an external ſigne indeed (&amp; not only the accidents of a ſign) as well as the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Fiftly, that the fathers of the old teſtament did eat <hi>the ſame ſpirituall meat, &amp; drink the ſame ſpirituall drink</hi> that we do: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 3. who could not carnally eat Chriſts fleſh, and drinke his blood: he then not being made man.

               <p>The Popiſh Maſſe to be a propitiatory ſacrifice for the quick and the dead, we lay on the ground (as <hi>Dauid</hi> did great <hi>Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah)</hi> by the ſword of the ſpirit the word of God. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. and 25. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
               <p>All praier to ſaints we ouerthrow by the ſame ſword. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>in the day of our trouble</hi> (when if euer we haue need of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther friends to ſolicite our cauſe to God, then eſpecially we haue need of them, ſuch trouble teſtifying God to be diſpleaſed with vs) becauſe (I ſay) in the day of ſuch trouble, we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to cal vpon God: <hi>Pſa.</hi> 50. 15. and vpon no other. Secondly becauſe from the beginning of the ſcriptures to the end, there is neither precept, nor example, nor any ſentence to warrant inuocation of ſaints. Thirdly, becauſe this is derogatory and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:18428:118"/> diſgracefull to the onely mediation of Chriſt before ſpoken of: yea, it is blaſphemous againſt the ſame. Fourthly, becauſe although it ſhould be granted that the Saints departed doe know our neceſſities, yet they know not our hearts, whether when we pray for our ſelues, we pray in faith and trueth, or no.</p>
               <p>All praier for the dead we wound mortally by the ſame wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, becauſe the word teacheth vs that they that die, and are tranſlated out of this world, they die either <hi>in the Lord, and ſo are bleſſed, and reſt from their labor, and haue their reward with God in heauen: Reu.</hi> 14. 13. or els they die out of the Lord, and ſo they goe to that rich man of whom the Goſpell maketh mention, euen to the diuell and his angels, where they are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for euer, and from whence there is no more paſſage to heauen, then from heauen thither: <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 26. And this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold diſtinction of men dying either in Chriſt or out of Chriſt, either in the ſtate of ſaluation to goe preſently to God in heauen, or in the ſtate of damnation to be thrown immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly into hell, without any third ſort either of men here, or of ſtate and place after this life, we gather from our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaving, <hi>Either make the tree good and his fruit good, or the tree euill and his fruit euill: Mat.</hi> 12. 33. So he maketh only two ſorts of men here, all to be good or euill: therefore he exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth any middle ſort: and ſo conſequently denieth alſo all middle ſtate or place after this life diſtinct from heauen and hell. Secondly, we wound the former hereſie of praying for the dead, by the forme of praier preſcribed by our Sauiour, wherein he teacheth vs to pray only for them <hi>that may doe the will of God vpon earth, that haue need of daily bread for this life, and that are in danger of tentation and other euill:</hi> al which things do belong only to the liuing in this world.</p>
               <p>Worſhipping of images, or of God in images, we doe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wound vnto death by the ſame word: viz. by the ſecond commandement, and by infinit other Scriptures in the old teſtament, and by ſome alſo in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:18428:118"/> are we forbidden, the worſhip of dead and helpleſſe images. Thirdly, becauſe there ſhould be ſome reſemblance betwixt that that putteth vs in mind of another thing, and the thing it ſelfe whereof it putteth vs in mind. But there is not ſo much ſimilitude betwixt God and images as there is (according to our common ſpeech) betwixt an apple and an oyſter. For both theſe are the good creatures of God: they are both meat for man: either of both are beyond the power of man to make. But there is no agreement at all betwixt God and idols or images: <hi>What fellowſhip hath righteouſneſſe with vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and what communion hath light with darknes? &amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>&amp;c. Images haue mouthes and ſpeake not: eies and ſee not: eares and heare not: hands and handle not, feet and walke not</hi> (as before we heard) <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 28. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But God hath no eies, and yet ſeeth all things; no eares, and yet heareth all things; no mouth, and yet ſpeaketh vnto vs by his word; no hands, and yet doth, and ruleth all things: he hath no feet, and yet is euery where. Laſt of all, for images to put vs in mind of God is derogatory to the Sacraments; eſpecially to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, which Chriſt himſelfe inſtituted chiefly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him. That which I haue ſaid of ſome of the chiefe hereſies of Popery, I might ſhew of the reſt: ſo likewiſe of other hereſies. To deale in like manner with all, would be too large for this place.</p>
               <p>By theſe things but thus briefly written other may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. And thus we ſee what an excellent priuiledge the children of God haue by the word of God, being ſuch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of proofe as we haue heard it to be for defence of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt all ſinnes, both of practiſe, and alſo of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yea, this priuiledge is the greater, becauſe all the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and meer naturall men being without this word, are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a wofull ſtate, altogether vnarmed, naked, lying open to the enemy of their ſoules, yea, being indeed in his poſeſſion, as before we haue often heard. For although the Apoſtle doe deſcribe other parts of the chriſtian armor, yet none can haue any of thoſe other parts, except he haue the word: The word is the moſt principall of all the reſt: as being the meanes (as before hath been ſhewed) of all the reſt. Thus much for the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:18428:119"/> ſecond conſideration of the word in this place: viz. as it is a ſpeciall part of our ſpirituall armor to defend our ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemies of our ſaluation.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He third conſideration of the word before mentioned yet remaining, is, as it is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialleſt conſolation and comfort of the children of God in their afflictions. This I haue reſerued for this laſt place, becauſe it ariſeth from the two former. For if the word of God be ſo perfect (as before wee heard) then it muſt needs be a word of comfort. If alſo it be ſuch a ſpeciall part of our chriſtian armor for our defence (as before alſo we haue ſeen it to be) then it cannot but miniſter likewiſe great comfort vnto vs. For where a man hath many and mighty enemies, there cannot but be great feare: where there is great feare, there cannot but be great heauineſſe alſo. Yea, what (almoſt) is feare but the heauineſſe of heart, from the expectation of ſome euill? So far therefore as the word doth arme vs againſt our enemies, whom we haue moſt cauſe to feare, ſo far it cannot but be a great comfort vnto vs.</p>
               <p>This that I ſpeake of the comfort of the children of God by the word of God, <hi>Dauid</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. both ſaying that <hi>the statutes of the Lord are right and reioice the heart:</hi> verſe 8. and alſo adding, that <hi>they are ſweeter then the hony and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny combe:</hi> verſ. 10. But we are there to obſerue, theſe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations to bee placed after ſome other attributes and effects, for which in the ſame Pſalme he had before commended the word, viz. after the <hi>perfection of it, and the conuerſion of the ſoule thereby:</hi> after the <hi>faithfulneſſe or ſureneſſe of it, and the giuing wiſedome vnto the ſimple, &amp;c.</hi> Thereby the Prophet giueth vs to vnderſtand, that the word of God doth reioice and comfort the heart only of thoſe, whom firſt it hath inwardly conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:18428:119"/> or reſtored, &amp; whom firſt it hath made <hi>wiſe vnto ſaluation, &amp;c.</hi> Therfore alſo he ſaith againe, <hi>This is my comfort in my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that thy promiſe</hi> (or thy word) <hi>doth quicken me: Pſal.</hi> 119. 50. that whereas by nature I am dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, thy word hath awakened me, and reſtored me to life, and ſo giuen me much comfort: and againe, <hi>This is my comfort, that I keep thy commandement,</hi> verſe 56. and againe, <hi>Except thy lawes had been my delight</hi> (or my comfort) <hi>I had long ſithence periſhed in mine afflictions:</hi> verſe 92,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> alſo doth not obſcurely ſignifie the word of God to be the word of comfort, when he ſaith, that <hi>whatſoeuer things are written afore time, are written for our learning, that we through pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and comfort of the ſcriptures might haue hope: Rom.</hi> 15. 4. Do we not here plainly ſee true comfort to be called the comfort of the ſcriptures? Another Apoſtle alſo ſetteth down the word for one of <hi>the two immutable things, whereby we might haue ſtrong conſolation, &amp;c. Heb.</hi> 6. 18. But what ſhall I need to ſtand long vpon this point? For (as afterward in the vſes of this dignity of Gods children we ſhall heare) this whole treatiſe is as well for comfort as for inſtruction.</p>
               <p>And how ſhall we know that God hath ſo loued vs, as to make vs his children, but by the word? How are we made the children of God, but by the word? How doe we vnderſtand any thing elſe, either before or after in this treatiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the dignitie of Gods children, but by the word?</p>
               <p>Yea, and that all true comfort is to be had by the word, our Sauiour ſeemeth to inſinuate, becauſe his diſciples being in great feare partly by a great tempeſt vpon the ſea, partly and more ſpecially becauſe ſeeing him come towards them wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon the ſea, they imagined him to be a ſpirit, though our ſauiour by his bodily eies ſeeing their trouble by the tempeſt, and by his diuine nature vnderſtanding their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of him, could ſecretly by his ſaid diuine nature and power haue taken all feare from them, and comforted them, yet he did rather comfort them by his word and ſpeech, <note place="margin">Note.</note> ſaying vnto them, <hi>Be of good comfort, it is I, bee not afraid: Matth.</hi> 14. 27. Wherefore did hee thus rather then
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18428:120"/> otherwiſe, comfort them? Euen the better to ſanctifie and commend the word for the word of comfort for euer, to his diſciples, and to all other in any feare or heauineſſe, that ſo all might alwaies ſeek comfort, at no other fountaine then at the word of God. By the ſame meanes from time to time, hath the Lord comforted his children, <hi>Abraham, Iſack, Iacob, Dauid, Hezekiah, Paul</hi> and other in their afflictions, euen by his word, and by ſpeaking vnto them. When <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo wept much <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man was found worthy to open, to read, and to looke on the booke,</hi> which before he had <hi>ſeen in the right hand of him that ſate vpon the throne, &amp;c.</hi> how was <hi>he comforted?</hi> Not inwardly only by Gods ſpirit, but outwardly alſo by one of <hi>the elders ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto him,</hi> and ſaying <hi>Weep not, behold that Lyon, which is of the tribe of Iuda, that roote of Dauid, hath obtained to open the booke, and to open the ſeuen ſeales thereof: Reuel.</hi> 5. 5. Here is a double argument to proue the word of God to be the word of comfort. Firſt, becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> in his heauineſſe is comforted by the ſpeech of one of the elders vnto him. Secondly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the matter of the ſaid ſpeech. viz. that there was one found to open the booke and the ſeuen ſeales thereof. For thereby the holy ghoſt ſignifieth that without opening of the book before ſhewed to <hi>Iohn,</hi> there was nothing to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer benefits therfore, whatſoeuer friends, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer outward delights, whatſoeuer learning or other thing men haue, yet nothing will ſoundly comfort them that are heauy hearted, or exerciſed with feares, but the word. The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Goſpell healed of her bloudy iſſue (for healing whereof ſhe had ſpent all that ſhe had vpon the phyſitians, and was nothing the better) doth ſufficiently iuſtifie this. For when our Sauiour hauing ſo healed her for nothing, euen ſo perfectly healed her that ſhe ſenſibly felt her ſelfe to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; when (I ſay) our Sauiour hauing thus healed her, did but aske <hi>who had touched him, becauſe he had felt vertue to goe from him,</hi> ſhe had no more comfort then before, but (for all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit <note place="margin">Note.</note> of health ſo miraculouſly wrought in her) ſhe was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with great <hi>feare and trembling</hi> till ſhe came to our Sauiour, and till he ſpake vnto her ſaying <hi>Daughter be of good comfort,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:18428:120"/> thy faith hath ſaued thee: Luk</hi> 8. 47. 48. So then the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit did not comfort her (though ſhe had long deſired it) yea, it ſeemeth ſhe had more feare then before, but the word that our ſauiour ſpake, was it that tooke away the feare, and which did comfort her.</p>
               <p>I might here alſo ſpeake of <hi>Belſhazar</hi> in what caſe he was: <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. hauing no comfort in the word: but of him, and other like more afterward. In the meane time, let vs vnderſtand, that the word hath comforts of all ſorts, and for all afflictions; of this life, and of the life to come; for body and for ſoule.</p>
               <p>Is any of Gods children poore? he can comfort himſelfe with the word, ſaying <hi>Feare the Lord yee his Saints: for no good thing wanteth to them that feare him &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 34. 9. So with thoſe manifold comforts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 25. <hi>&amp;c. Luk.</hi> 12. 32. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So alſo with the examples of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 32. 10. of <hi>Elija,</hi> of the widow of <hi>Zarepta,</hi> and of the other widdow of one of the ſonnes of the Prophets before mentioned: and with Gods mighty proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, in feeding them with Manna, and quailes: and in giuing them water out of the rocke.</p>
               <p>Is any child of God in diſgrace, or in baſe condition? he can comfort himſelfe with 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5. and 6. and with the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Ioſeph, Dauid, Eſter</hi> and <hi>Mordecai:</hi> whom the Lord rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp from the duſt, and made to ſit with Princes: yea, and ſome of them to be Princes.</p>
               <p>Is any of them in priſon? He can comfort himſelfe with the examples of <hi>Ioſeph, Ieremiah, Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in priſon, but whom alſo the Lord moſt mightily deliuered out of priſon.</p>
               <p>Hath any many and great aduerſaries? He can conſider, that <hi>If God be with him, he need not feare who is againſt him: Rom.</hi> 8. 29. and that <hi>The Lord is alwaies at hand: Philip.</hi> 4. 6. And how the Lord deliuered <hi>Iacob</hi> from <hi>Eſau,</hi> and from the Seche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites: and <hi>Dauid</hi> from many mighty enemies.</p>
               <p>Is any ſicke and ſicke vnto death? He can call to mind how <hi>Hezekiah</hi> being ſo, and told alſo by the word of God that he ſhould die, was vpon his praier, miraculouſly reſtored to health, and had his life drawn out for fifteen yeeres more:
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:18428:121"/> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He can alſo remember, that <hi>Dauids ſoule was deliuered from the graue: Pſal.</hi> 103. 4. and that <hi>Epaphroditus being ſicke and neere vnto death, God had mercy on him: Phil.</hi> 2. 27.</p>
               <p>Hath any man loſt all his goods in one day, yea children alſo, &amp;c. He can comfort himſelfe with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 1. and with the example of <hi>Iob:</hi> who hauing loſt goods and children, did not only ſay, <hi>The Lord hath giuen and the Lord hath taken: Bleſſed be the name of the Lord: Iob.</hi> 1. 21. but who alſo had all, and more then all reſtored vnto him at the laſt: <hi>Iob.</hi> 42. 10.</p>
               <p>Is any man heauy loaden with his ſinnes? doth he feare the wrath of God and euerlaſting condemnation, and doth he not find or feele any comfort? yea doth he feele the terrors of death? Oh how may he comfort himſelfe with the doctrine of Gods mercy: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before handled: with the end of Chriſts comming <hi>to heale them that are ſicke, not the whole; to call ſinners, not the righteous to repentance: Mat.</hi> 9. 12. 13. <hi>to ſeeke and to ſaue that which was lost: Luk.</hi> 19. 10. <hi>that euery one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth in him, might not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life? Iohn</hi> 3. 6. with the words alſo of the Prophet, <hi>Ho, euery one that thirſteth, &amp;c. Iſai.</hi> 5. 5. 1. with the words of our Sauiour, <hi>Come vnto me all ye that are weary and laden, and I will refreſh you: Mat.</hi> 11. 28. And laſtly with the examples of ſuch as haue found comfort in ſuch an heauy condition, and againſt great and many ſins: viz. of <hi>Dauid,</hi> of <hi>Salomon,</hi> of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> of <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi> of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> and of diuers other?</p>
               <p>Seing then the word of God hath ſuch excellent and ſuch ſweet comforts for euery malady, for euery affliction, for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heauineſſe; who can ſufficiently expreſſe the dignity and prerogatiue of the children of God thereby? For they only can receiue comfort by it. <hi>The childrens bread doth not belong to whelpes: Mat.</hi> 15. 26. Neither <hi>do the holy things of God belong to dogs:</hi> neither <hi>doe ſuch pearles become ſwine: Mat.</hi> 7. 6.</p>
               <p>All this hitherto ſaid of the word is the more, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the writing thereof, and alſo of the preaching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. In both theſe reſpects (I ſay) the prerogatiue of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God by the word is the greater. For as touching the writing thereof, howſoeuer the Papiſts would perſwade that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:18428:121"/> it was written onely by the voluntary accord of man, not by any expreſſe commandement of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and that therefore it were as well now if wee had no word written at all, but that all were deliuered vnto vs only by tradition: yet it is certain, both that God himſelfe commanded the word from time to time to be written; and alſo that it was ſo written to very great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and for very great vſe of the children of God.</p>
               <p>That the word was written by Gods expreſſe commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, many places doe teſtifie: <hi>Ier.</hi> 30. 2. and 36. 2. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſpeciall purpoſes of ſo writing the word of God, are two: Firſt, that the Church might the leſſe erre touching the word: for if all ſhould haue beene by tradition, men might haue deuiſed what they would, and pretended a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; who almoſt could haue controlled them? That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church might haue a certain rule both of faith, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of manners, againſt which no exception might be taken, it pleaſed God to command his word to bee written, for the better examining of all other writings and preachings thereby. Secondly, it was ſo written, that all men might the better haue the benefit thereof: as well priuately to read, as publikly to heare the ſame preached. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe ſometimes by perſecution; ſometimes by ſickneſſe; ſometimes by extremitie of weather; ſometimes by impriſonment; ſometimes by ſome other meanes they be kept from the publike miniſtrie thereof. Touching the preaching of it, the Lord tooke order alſo in that behalfe, for the better inſtruction of all by ſound interpretation, and by wiſe application of it, according to perſons, and times and places. For the preaching of the word is the right diuiding thereof, as euerie one needeth the ſame, in reſpect of age, of ſexe, of calling, of ſtate and condition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manner of way: 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. What a ſingular benefit is this, that all men, poore as well as rich, baſe as well as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, may haue the word, and ought to haue the word, as their ſeuerall neceſſitie requireth? And truely though a man know neuer ſo much, yea though a man be neuer ſo rich in faith and godlines, yet the preaching of the word is neceſſary:
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:18428:122"/> partly to increaſe his knowledge which is alwaies imperfect: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. and partly to helpe his memory in thoſe things he knoweth: yea to ſtrengthen the ſame, and as it were to ſtop the holes thereof for the time to come, that the things which they ſhall heare may not at any <hi>time runne out: Heb.</hi> 2. 1. and partly to quicken him, both to obedience according to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and alſo to make vſe of the word for his comfort, for his humbling, for his ſtrengthning that he may not fall: for his raiſing if hee ſhall fall, and many other waies. For alaſſe, what is the beſt and moſt godly man that is, but drouſie and dull: needing both to be awakened daily, and alſo (with the ſpurre (as it were) of the word) to bee quickned: yea, what is the greateſt meaſure of faith, of loue, of zeale, of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of patience, and of any piety in any man here vpon the earth, but as a little fire (a coale or two) kindled vnder and in a great deale of greenewood, which will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee quenched and goe out, without continuall puffing and blowing, for nouriſhing, maintaining, and encreaſing thereof?</p>
               <p>Neither is the word of God in this manner onely a great benefit for the children of GOD in reſpect of the writing and preaching thereof, that ſo they may both heare it and read it, but alſo becauſe they may at all times both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre thereof with other; and alſo priuately meditate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by themſelues: yea this conference and meditation muſt goe with hearing and reading. Otherwiſe all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and reading will bee to little purpoſe; yea whatſoeuer wee learne by hearing and reading, it will quickly vaniſh and come to nothing. As the two diſciples that were going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> did talke and conferre together of thoſe things that had fallen out at Ieruſalem concerning Chriſt: <hi>Luk</hi> 24. 14. and as the men of <hi>Berea,</hi> did not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with hearing, but conferred together of the things they had heard, and <hi>ſearched the Scriptures daily whether thoſe things</hi> (viz. which they had heard) <hi>were ſo or no: Acts</hi> 17. 11. ſo may, and muſt, and will all the children of God do, touching the things they heare. The like is to be ſaid of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Therefore, as <hi>Ioſhua</hi> is commanded <hi>to meditate in
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:18428:122"/> the law of God day and night: Ioſh.</hi> 1. 8. and as it is commended to be the continuall exerciſe of the man that is bleſſed: <hi>Pſal</hi> 1. 2. to teach that he is none of the bleſſed company, that doth not ſo meditate on the law: ſo it was practiſed by <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe, who proueth his exceeding loue vnto the word of God (euen ſuch as wherof he was in a manner ſick, and the which he could not wel expreſſe) by this argument ſaying: <hi>Oh how loue I thy law! it is my meditation continually: Pſal.</hi> 119. 97. This is ſuch a worke, as wherin the children of God may euen in the night as they ly in their bed, when they haue no light whereby they may read; in the way as they walke or ride; in their ſickneſſe, lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in impriſonment, when all other comforts doe faile them; yea, in their old age, and when their eie-ſight is either dim and weake, not able to endure reading, or none at all: and when they ſhall be deafe not hearing any thing; or at the leaſt, not able to endure the ſpeech of any: finally, when all other things will be loathſome vnto them: Euen then (I ſay) may the children of God exerciſe themſelues to their great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and to a ſweet paſſing away of the time in meditation of the word. This is the more, becauſe the wicked not hauing this priuiledge do either ſpend their time in eating, drinking, ſwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, carding, dicing, dancing, chambering, wantonneſſe, and in all vanity: or elſe they find all things more tedious vnto them then they can beare.</p>
               <p>Aboue all things, great is the benefit of the word for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vſes, becauſe it may be and muſt be locked vp in the cheſt of our hearts: <hi>Iob.</hi> 22. 22. <hi>Pro.</hi> 2. 2. and 10. &amp; 3. 3. 4. ſo that when we fall into the hands of theeues that rob vs of al other things, yet that cannot be taken away from vs: yea, though men take away our liues, yet the benefit of the word ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with vs: For this is <hi>that good part that Mary did chuſe,</hi> which our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>ſhould not be taken away from her: Luk.</hi> 10. 42.</p>
               <p>This eſpecially is proper to the children of God. Many of the wicked heare the word, read the word, confer of the word, &amp; no doubt alſo but do oft meditate of the word (though ſomtimes rather for euil then for good, as al Papiſts &amp; heretiks do ſtudy the word, the more to maintaine their hereſies contrary to the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:18428:123"/> word) but only the children of God doe lay and lock it vp in their hearts to their euerlaſting good.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore this point; If it were one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt preferments of the Iewes aboue the Gentiles before the comming of Chriſt, that the Lord gaue them <hi>his word, his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and his iudgements: Pſal.</hi> 147. 19. and that <hi>to them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Oracles of God: Rom.</hi> 3. 2. viz. outwardly and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the letter to be kept by them, whereas no other nation had the like benefit: then how great is this priuiledge of the children of God aboue the wicked, that they only haue the keeping of his word in the cloſets and cofers of their hearts to their euerlaſting good? Thus much of the dignity of Gods children by the word of God.</p>
               <p>It remaineth now to ſpeake of the Sacraments, wherein I may and will be the ſhorter, becauſe they are only ſeales for confirmation of the word: and either to ſtrengthen our faith the more in the promiſes of God, or to quicken our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the more vnto the commandements of God. For as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching baptiſme, it is inſtituted, firſt of all, the better to aſſure vs of the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes by the bloud of Chriſt, by that viſible element of water which therein is to be vſed. This <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth when he exhorteth them that by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>were pricked in their hearts, to bee</hi> baptized <hi>in the name of</hi> Ieſus Chriſt <hi>for the remiſſion of ſinnes: Acts</hi> 2. 38. becauſe as the water waſheth away the filth of the body, ſo the bloud of <hi>Chriſt clenſeth vs from all our ſinnes: Rom.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 20. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1. 5. Secondly, baptiſme was inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a Sacrament alſo of repentance and regeneration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the bloud of Chriſt doth not onely waſh vs from the guilt of our ſinnes, but alſo from the ſpot and blemiſh of them, as we haue heard before. And therefore <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that <hi>we were elect</hi> (or ſelect, viz. in our calling) <hi>vnto ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the spirit, through the obedience and ſprinkling of the bloud of Chriſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. and againe, that <hi>We were redeemed from our vaine conuerſation receiued by tradition of our fathers, by the pretious bloud of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> verſe 18. 19. Another Apoſtle alſo ſaith that <hi>the bloud of Chriſt ſhall purge our conſciences from dead works to ſerue the liuing God: Heb.</hi> 9. 14. Therfore (to apply theſe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18428:123"/> things vnto baptiſme) the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> is called <hi>the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of repentance: Acts</hi> 19, 4. and <hi>Iohn</hi> neuer baptized but hee preached repentance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 8. Therefore alſo baptiſme is ſaid to teach vs <hi>to die vnto ſinne, and to liue vnto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: Rom.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. In the ſame reſpect <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt gaue himſelfe for the Church, that he might ſanctifie it, and clenſe it, by the waſhing of water through the word, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 26. In which words the Apoſtle at leaſt alludeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to baptiſme, and againe he ſeemeth to vnderſtand baptiſme <hi>by the waſhing of the new birth: Tit.</hi> 3. 5. The Apoſtle alſo to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſeemeth to allude to baptiſme, when hee ſaith, that <hi>wee are purged in our hearts from an euill conſcience, and waſhed in our bodies with pure water: Hebr.</hi> 10. 22. Finally, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching both the former ends of baptiſme, baptiſme is ſaid to bee <hi>the baptiſme of repentance, and forgiuneſſe of ſinnes, Mark.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>As baptiſme ſo ſerueth for confirmation of faith and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in godlineſſe: ſo doth alſo the ſupper of the Lord. The bread that wee eate, and the wine that wee drinke in a religious manner according to Chriſts inſtitution, doth teach vs, that as the bread and wine are incorporated into our bodies, and made one with them: ſo Chriſts his fleſh and blood are ſpiritually incorporated into vs, and wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt through faith, whereby it is ſaid, (as wee heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that <hi>Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts: Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17. In which reſpect, <hi>the cup of blesſing,</hi> which the Miniſter in the celebration of the Supper <hi>bleſſeth</hi> (that is, which hee praieth God to bleſſe to that ſpeciall and holy vſe) is ſaid to bee <hi>the communion of the blood of Chriſt:</hi> and that <hi>the bread which he ſo bleſſeth,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>the communion of the body of Chriſt:</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16.</p>
               <p>And indeed the Supper of the Lord by the viſible elements and the viſible actions therein commanded by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, putting vs better in remembrance of all that Chriſt hath done for vs, and better <hi>ſhewing his death till he come, 1. Cor.</hi> 11. 24. 25. 26. then bare preaching would doe (for ſo our eies doe ſee, our hands doe handle, our tongues doe taſte, and our ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maks by the vertue of the bread and wine do feele that which
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18428:124"/> in the word preached our eares doe heare) it cannot but be a maruellous and moſt comfortable confirmation of our faith, both for euerlaſting ſaluation in the world to come, and alſo for all things neceſſary for this life in this preſent world. For how can we doubt of ſaluation, which Chriſt Ieſus hath ſo deerly purchaſed for vs? and the price whereof we ſee in ſo liuely manner repreſented vnto vs by the bread and the wine: by the breaking of the one, and the pouring out of the other? would he giue ſo much for vs, and then leaue vs in the ſuds or in danger? Yea, do not the bread and the wine, with the eating of the one, and drinking of the other teach vs, that Chriſts fleſh and bloud are meat indeed and drinke indeed, to preſerue vs to that eternall life, which he by his death hath purchaſed for vs? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 51. 52. 53. 54. 55. 56. Hath Chriſt paid ſo deerly for vs, and doth he feed vs ſo daintily, and with ſuch coſtly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et (better then Angels food) and will he loſe vs, and ſuffer vs to periſh, and to be taken out of his hands? yea, ſith we, <hi>that eat his fleſh, and drinke his bloud ſpiritually</hi> (not only in the word, but alſo in the Sacrament) <hi>doe dwell in Chriſt, and haue Chriſt dwelling in vs</hi> (as Chriſt himſelfe in the place before alledged doth teſtifie) will he diſpoſſeſſe himſelfe of his habitation? or hauing all power in heauen, in earth, and euery where els in his hands, can he violently by any other power be thruſt out of his houſe and home? yea, ſith (as we haue heard) the ſupper of the Lord doth plainly teach vs that <hi>wee are fleſh of his fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> can we periſh, and he not alſo periſh?</p>
               <p>Touching things neceſſary for this life, whiles we liue in this world, the ſupper of the Lord by putting vs in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Chriſt himſelfe, doth alſo moſt comfortably aſſure vs of them. For he that <hi>ſpared not his owne ſonne but gaue him for vs all, how ſhall he not with him giue vs all other things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo? Rom.</hi> 8. 32. And <hi>he that ſpared not his owne life, and his owne ſoule, but gaue them for vs, and daily doth giue them vnto vs by faith, how ſhall he not (being made the heire of all things: Heb.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>and hauing all things in his power and at his diſpoſition) how ſhall hee not</hi> (I ſay) <hi>with himſelfe giue vs all things alſo?</hi> yea, this phraſe, <hi>how ſhall he not,</hi> noteth it to be impoſſible not to giue vs all things. <hi>All things</hi> (I ſay) not only for the life to come, but alſo
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18428:124"/> for this. For the generall, <hi>all things,</hi> comprehendeth both the particular ſorts of things. And if we may aſſure our ſelues the more of all things for the life to come, how can we doubt of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for this life? <hi>Feare not little flocke</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour ſpeaking in this very argument) <hi>for it is your fathers pleaſure to giue you a kingdome: Luk.</hi> 12. 32. Is it our fathers pleaſure for Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſts ſake to giue vs a kingdome, and ſhall he ſtick at gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs the trifles of this life? The ſupper of the Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſſuring vs, that the Father hath giuen vs Chriſt, and that by Chriſt, and with Chriſt, and for Chriſts ſake he will giue vs a kingdome, doth likewiſe much more aſſure vs, that he will giue vs all other things, which in reſpect of Chriſt himſelfe, and of that kingdome, are but trifles.</p>
               <p>As the ſupper of the Lord doth thus make for confirmation of our faith, ſo doth it alſo for our inſtruction in godlineſſe: and for our prouocation to the loue of him that hath ſo loued vs. For did he ſo loue vs altogether voide of goodneſſe, and therefore vnworthy to be loued, and ſhall not we much more loue him, that is free from all euill, the fountaine of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and moſt worthy of our loue? Verily though he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo loued vs, yet he was and is worthy of our loue, becauſe of his perfect, and infinit goodneſſe. How much more then is he worthy of our loue that hath ſo loued vs, and that in ſuch exceeding manner, that as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh of the loue of <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, Thy loue to mee was wonderfull, paſſing the loue of women:</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 26. ſo euery child of God may much more ſay of the loue of Chriſt, <hi>Thy loue to me was wonderfull, paſſing the loue of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> yea of any mother towards her child, or of any woman towards her husband: yea <hi>of any Virgin</hi> (or new married yong woman) <hi>towards the husband of her youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe the ſupper of the Lord doth ſerue to prouoke vs to the loue one of another. Firſt by repreſenting ſo vnto vs the loue of Chriſt, as we haue heard. Secondly by teaching vs that we are all of the ſame family; yea members of the ſame body by ſitting at the ſame table: by eating all of the ſame bread, and drinking all of the ſame wine. For hath Chriſt ſo high and excellent, and ſo far aboue vs, ſo loued vs his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and ſhall not we loue one another? Hath he ſo loued vs,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:18428:125"/> that neuer deſerued any loue at his hands, and who neuer can be any waies beneficiall vnto him? and ſhall not wee much more loue one another, that either are beholding one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or that may bee beneficiall one towards another, if not any other way, yet at leaſt by praying one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Shall wee alſo by ſitting, by eating, and drinking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in one houſe, euen in the houſe of the Lord, and at one table, euen at the Table of the Lord, teſtifie ourſelues to bee ſeruants to the ſame Lord, children of the ſame Father, and members of the ſame body: and ſhall we not prouoke one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thereby, to the mutuall loue one of another?</p>
               <p>I might applie to this purpoſe the exhortation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in that behalfe: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 1. 2. and 1. <hi>Ioh</hi> 4 11. and other the like: But in a caſe ſo plaine, ſuch labour may well be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Let vs only remember, that here by loue towards God and men, we muſt not only vnderſtand the affection of loue, but all ſuch duties and works of loue, as whereby we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter declare our loue to God, to Chriſt Ieſus, and one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and ſo ſhew our ſelues the more thankfull for his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and incomprehenſible loue towards vs: <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10. and 10. 24.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore this point, and this Chapter, by theſe things thus written of the two Sacraments, who ſeeth not the great prerogatiue of all the children of God? If a man be weake and ſicke, not able to goe without a ſtaffe, and yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no ſtaffe to goe with, doth not he a great pleaſure vnto him, that ſhall giue him a ſtaffe the better to ſtay him in his walking? Is it not eſpecially both a great helpe, and alſo a great grace if a Prince ſhall giue a ſtaffe to ſome poore man that is ſicke and weake? yea, not onely one ſtaffe, but two for each hand (as it were) one? and both (according to the magnificence of a Prince) of beaten gold? All the children of God are ſicke: they are weake: they cannot walke without ſtaues: they are ſo poore that they haue not a ſtaffe of their owne: neither can they buy one, neither can they make one. Chriſt Ieſus therefore the Prince of Princes of his Princely grace and magnificence, hath giuen two, for each
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:18428:125"/> hand one, both of beaten gold: yea, much more precious then the fineſt gold: for ſuch as the word is, ſuch are the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Theſe two golden ſtaues (more pretious then gold) hath Chriſt Ieſus giuen to the children of God: firſt the one, and then as they grow better able to guide two, another, to walke with in this ſlippery, and ſtumbling world: the better to ſtay and ſupport them. Great therefore, and very great is the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the children of God by the two Sacraments: as it were by two moſt pretious ſtaues giuen vnto them by Ieſus Chriſt the Lord of heauen and earth. Thus much of the word, and alſo of the Sacraments.</p>

               <p>This the Apoſtle expreſly teſtifieth ſaying, <hi>In whom</hi> (that is in Chriſt) <hi>we haue boldneſſe, and entrance with confidence</hi> (or full aſſurance) <hi>by faith in him.

This aſſurance our Sauiour himſelfe alſo maketh vnto vs, ſaying: <hi>Aske and ye ſhall haue: ſeeke and yee ſhall finde: knocke and it ſhall bee opened vnto you: Matth.</hi> 7. 7. Yea hee addeth, that <hi>If wee that are euill can giue good things to our children, when they aske vs, much more ſhall our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie father giue good things to vs that aske them:</hi> verſe 11. ſo he maketh God much more ready to giue any good thing

The like aſſurance (euen of all ſuch good things) we haue made vs alſo by our Sauiour in diuers other places, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 22. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 13. 14. &amp; 15. 17 In the which laſt place our Sauior plainly teacheth, that our aſſurance of ſpeeding in all our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full requeſts, is by our communion with him. For <hi>If ye abide in me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and my words abide in you</hi> (note here how we may know our ſelues to abide in Chriſt, viz. <hi>by the abiding of his words in vs) aske what ye will, and it ſhall be done vnto you.</hi> Can we haue greater promiſes? Can we haue better aſſurance? Verily we can haue no greater promiſe then the promiſe of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; and that of whatſoeuer we ſhall aske: yet haue we better aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance. For Chriſt hath not only promiſed whatſoeuer wee ſhall aske, but hee hath alſo purchaſed for vs whatſoeuer he hath promiſed, and that at the ſame price, whereby hee hath purchaſed the fauour of his Father for vs. Yea, himſelfe (I meane Chriſt) hath praied for all things for vs: eſpecially for all things belonging to the life to come: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, he doth ſit for euer at the right hand of God his father, and there maketh continuall and daily interceſſion (by vertue of his former righteouſneſſe) for the performance of all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promiſed: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. and whatſoeuer he asketh at any time, or hath asked, therein he is heard by his Father: for ſo he ſaith to his father, <hi>I know thou heareſt me alwaies: Ioh.</hi> 11. 42. So alſo <hi>Martha</hi> had confeſſed before in the ſame Chapter, <hi>I know that whatſoeuer thou askeſt of God, God will giue it thee:</hi> verſe 22. Both which teſtimonies are to be vnderſtood of thoſe things that Chriſt asked for other: not of any thing for himſelfe. This
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18428:126"/> is an vnſpeakable prerogatiue. If we had the like preferment, and the like liberty with the like aſſurance with ſome great and mighty monarke of the earth, were it not a great honor? How much more honorable then is this, to haue this bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and aſſurance with God himſelfe? This is the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we need not feare being troubleſome in comming too often to God: For the oftner we come in faith and with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the more welcome and acceptable we ſhall be vnto him. For he hath not only bid vs to come, but to come againe and againe: yea, to continue in praier: <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 4. 2. 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
               <p>Euery benefit alſo obtained, is a pledge, and an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the asking of another. If we be not weary of asking, God will neuer be weary of giuing.</p>
               <p>Yea, by Chriſt Ieſus, and by our adoption in him to be the children of God, we haue aſſurance, not only of the things we aske, but alſo of other things: euen <hi>exceeding abundantly aboue all we aske, or thinke: Epheſ.</hi> 3. 20. according to Gods owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>to all the ſeed of the bleſſed of the Lord, and to their buds with them: that before they ſhould call he would anſwer: and whiles they ſhould ſpeake he would heare: Iſai.</hi> 65. 23. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> asked but wiſedome: but God gaue him not only <hi>a wiſe and an vnderſtanding heart, aboue all that euer had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, or ſhould be after him: but he alſo gaue him that which he had not asked, both riches and honor, ſo that among the Kings, there was none like vnto him all his daies:</hi> 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The poore man in the Goſpell, asked only the throwing of the diuell out of his child: but Chriſt did not only throw him out, but forbid him to enter any more into him: <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 25.</p>
               <p>God gaue vs all that we haue at the firſt, before we asked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing: and ſo he giueth daily more then we aske. For (alas) how poore, naked, and miſerable ſhould we be, if God ſhould giue vs no more then we doe aske? yea, the truth is, that the gift of an heart vnto vs, for the asking of any thing as wee ſhould aske it, is more, then all (almoſt) that we doe aske. Yea, it is a good aſſurance vnto vs of any thing that we do aske. For an heart ſo to aske is the worke of the ſpirit: and the grones of ſuch an heart are called the grones, or the ſighs, and requeſts of the ſpirit: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. 27. Can God reiect the grones, the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18428:127"/> ſighs, and requeſts of his owne Spirit?</p>
               <p>Neither haue we boldneſſe onely to aske, and aſſurance to ſpeed when we aske by thoſe things before ſpoken, but alſo by the mighty and glorious ſucceſſe that the praiers of Gods children haue alwaies had with God.</p>
               <p>For certainly a poore man that is the child of God, by his praier of faith may doe more with God, then the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in all the world that is none of Gods regenerate chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, can doe with all his wealth, or with all the power he can make.</p>
               <p>So mighty were the praiers of <hi>Iacob,</hi> that it is ſaid that hee <hi>wreſtled with God, and would not leaue wreſtling till God had bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him:</hi> and that bleſſing of God was the change of his name <hi>Iaacob into Iſrael,</hi> with this gracious anſwer, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt had power with God, thou ſhalt alſo preuaile with men: Gen.</hi> 32. 24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that this was to be vnderſtood of <hi>Iacob</hi> in reſpect of his praiers, it is the more manifeſt, becauſe that hiſtory of his <hi>wreſtling and hauing power with God,</hi> as alſo of the gracious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of God to his requeſt <hi>of a bleſſing,</hi> viz. that <hi>becauſe hee had had ſuch power with God, he ſhould alſo preuaile with men;</hi> becauſe (I ſay) all this hiſtory is ſet down immediatly vpon the earneſt praier that in the ſame Chapter verſe 9. he had made <hi>to God to be deliuered from his brother Eſau.</hi> And indeed as he had praied to be deliuered from <hi>Eſau,</hi> and as God vpon that praier had <hi>promiſed that hee ſhould preuaile with men:</hi> ſo although <hi>Eſau</hi> came out againſt him like a lion with a great band of men, yet the Lord made ſuch a change of his heart, that at their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Iaacob</hi> found him as calme, and as meeke as a lambe, as we ſee in Chap. 33.</p>
               <p>So mighty were the praiers of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſuch power had he with God by his praiers, that ſo long as <hi>he held vp his hands</hi> (viz. in praying) <hi>Iſrael preuailed againſt the Amalekites; but when he let his hand downe</hi> (that is, when through weakneſſe of body he could not continue the holding them vp in praier) <hi>then Amaleck preuailed: Ezod.</hi> 17. 11 So his praiers were of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force, then all the hoſt of Iſrael beſides.</p>
               <p>So mighty were the praiers of the ſaid <hi>Moſes</hi> afterward, and <hi>ſuch power had they with God,</hi> when he praied for the Iſraelites
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:18428:127"/> hauing greatly prouoked Gods wrath by making them a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den calfe, that the Lord both (as it were) intreated him to <hi>let him alone, that his wrath might wax hot againſt them,</hi> and alſo promiſed, that if he would ſo let him alone (that is, if he would hold his peace, and not ſollicit God with his praiers for the Iſraelites) <hi>he would make of him a mighty people, Exod.</hi> 32. 10. &amp;c. inſinuating notwithſtanding thereby, that if hee would for all that hold on in praying for them, and would not be hired by the former great promiſe to hold his peace, then hee could not proceed in his wrath againſt them as they had deſerued, but muſt needs yeeld to <hi>Moſes</hi> intreating mercy for them. What can bee more powerfull, then to ouercome, and (as it were) to withhold him that is of all power, from doing of that which otherwiſe he would haue done?</p>
               <p>So mighty were the praiers of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> and ſo did he <hi>preuaile with God</hi> by them, that (after an imperious and commanding manner) they made the <hi>Sunne and the Moone</hi> (whoſe courſe is ſwifter then the weauers ſhettle, or then the flight of the ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or of the arrow) <hi>to ſtand ſtill in the firmament,</hi> till hee and the reſt of the Iſraelites <hi>had auenged themſelues of their enemies: Ioſh.</hi> 10. 12. 13. So the very celeſtiall bodies are (as it were) at the command of the praiers of Gods children.</p>
               <p>So mighty were the praiers of <hi>Elijah,</hi> that <hi>he praying earneſtly that it might not raine, it rained not on the earth</hi> (at leaſt in that country) <hi>for three yeeres and ſix moneths:</hi> and that praying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <hi>for raine, the heauens gaue raine, and the earth gaue foorth her increaſe: Iames</hi> 5. 17. 18. out of 1. <hi>King.</hi> 17. 1. and 18. 42. &amp;c. So the children of God by their praiers can make the clouds to forbeare raine, or to giue raine, as ſhall make moſt to Gods glorie.</p>
               <p>So mighty were the praiers of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and <hi>ſuch power had hee with God by them,</hi> that they obtained of God a ſonne for the <hi>Shunamite</hi> that was barren, and recouered life againe for him when he was dead: 2. <hi>King</hi> 4 16. and 35. and that alſo after that praying the Lord <hi>to ſmite the armie of the Aramites with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they were ſmitten with ſuch blindneſſe,</hi> that albeit they could ſee other things, yet they could not ſee (to diſcerne) their way, but (as men ſtone-blinde) were led by <hi>Eliſha,</hi> till they were
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:18428:128"/> brought into the midſt of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and were there in the hands of their enemies: 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So mighty were the praiers of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>ſuch power had they with God,</hi> that whereas he was <hi>ſicke vnto the death</hi> (that is, ſo ſicke that he was vnrecouerable either by ſtrength of his own nature, or by the art and skill of any Phyſitian) and God alſo by his Prophet had told him <hi>he ſhould die,</hi> and had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo willed him <hi>to put his houſe in order</hi> (that is, to make his laſt will and Teſtament) becauſe <hi>hee ſhould die and not liue,</hi> yet the Lord reuoked that his owne word, and contrary (in ſome ſort) thereunto, as alſo aboue the ſtrength of nature, and the art of man, did reſtore him to health and added fifteen yeers vnto his life: 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 2. 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So mighty were the praiers of <hi>Ester, Mordecai,</hi> and the reſt of the Iewes, and <hi>ſuch power had they with God</hi> by their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that the Lord turned the wrath of <hi>Ahaſhueroſh</hi> from them againſt <hi>Haman</hi> and other their enemies: albeit <hi>Haman</hi> had before that ſo far preuailed with <hi>Ahaſhueroſh, that he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his letters, and ſealed them with his ring, and ſent them by his Poſts into all prouinces, for the deſtruction of the ſaid Mordecai</hi> and all the reſt of the Iewes, yong and old: <hi>Eſter</hi> 3. 12. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with 4. 16. and 17. and 7. 5. and 8. 1. &amp;c. So the praiers of Gods children haue had power with God, for children for them that are barren: for life for them that are dead: for blindneſſe vpon them that ſee: for health for them that are ſicke, euen vnto death, and paſt all hope: and for the changing of the hearts of men, from extreame wrath to exceeding loue and fauour.</p>
               <p>So mighty were the praiers of the Church for <hi>Peter</hi> by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> committed to priſon, and <hi>ſuch power had they with God,</hi> that <hi>the Angell of the Lord came,</hi> with great power and glory into the priſon, <hi>and brake off Peters chaines, opened the priſon dores, brought him out and made the yron gate open of it owne accord, &amp;c. Acts</hi> 12. 7. So the praiers of Gods children are ſtronger then any yron. So mighty were the praiers of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in priſon, that at <hi>midnight ſuddenly there was a great earthquake, ſo that the foundation of the priſon was ſhaken, and by and by all the dores opened, and euery mans bonds were looſed, &amp;c. Act.</hi> 16. 25. 26.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:18428:128"/> So though <hi>the earth be ſet vpon her foundation that it ſhall neuer moue</hi> (viz. wholly out of her place) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10 4. 5. yet we ſee it to haue been ſhaken by the praiers of Gods children.</p>
               <p>Neither are the praiers of Gods children ſo effectuall for other only of their own ſort, but alſo ſometime for the wicked &amp; reprobate. How did the Lord heare <hi>Abraham</hi> for <hi>Abimelech king of Gerar? Gen.</hi> 20. 7. <hi>Moſes</hi> praying often for <hi>Pharao?</hi> and the Prophet praying for the reſtoring of the withered hand of <hi>Ieroboam?</hi> 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 6. Do not all theſe mighty effects of praier (beſides many other the like both old and new) plainly teſtifie in what grace and fauour the children of God are with God? Verily they doe: for all the praiers before mentioned (whereof we haue heard thoſe mighty effects) were not the praiers of any wicked men, but only of the children of God. For indeed none can pray, ſo by praier <hi>to haue power with God,</hi> but only Gods children. For <hi>how ſhall they call on him in whom they haue not beleeued: Rom.</hi> 10. 14. This queſtion, <hi>how ſhall they, &amp;c.</hi> noteth it an impoſſible thing for them that haue not faith to call vpon God. But ſuch are all the wicked, (as before we haue heard) therefore none of the wicked can call vpon God. Therefore all the commandements of God for praier, are only to the children of God, and to ſuch as are godly.</p>
               <p>When the Prophet had ſet downe the commandement of God <hi>for calling vpon God in the day of trouble,</hi> with promiſe <hi>of deliuerance, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 50. 15. preſently by way of oppoſition he addeth, <hi>But vnto the wicked God ſaid, What haſt thou to doe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare mine ordinances, and to take my couenants in thy mouth, &amp;c.</hi> verſe 16. He teacheth hereby, firſt that the former comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement <hi>for calling vpon God in the day of trouble,</hi> was giuen on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Note.</note> to the godly, becauſe by way of oppoſition, God immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaketh otherwiſe to the wicked: Secondly, that if the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for all that will pray, yet the Lord is ſo far from approuing them in ſuch praiers, that he reproueth them rather for vſing that his ordinance not belonging vnto them, and for <hi>taking his couenant in their mouth,</hi> without which all praiers are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace, without good ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>So the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> alſo reproueth the Iewes and all their ſacrifices, with their obſeruation <hi>of new moones,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:18428:129"/> and appointed feaſts, and with their praiers</hi> (all which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he had commanded his people) the Lord (I ſay) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth all thoſe things in the Iewes for their wickedneſſe, and ſaith, <hi>Who required this at your hands to tread in my courts? Iſaiah</hi> 1. 12. and therefore afterward he biddeth them (if they will haue their ſuch ſeruice accepted of him) <hi>to waſh and make cleane themſelues, to take away the euill of their workes from before his eyes: to ceaſe to doe euill: to learne to doe well: to ſeeke iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c.</hi> verſ. 16. 17. So by the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> he ſaith to the Iewes of that time: <hi>Will ye ſteale, murder, and ſweare falſly and burne incenſe vnto Baal, &amp;c. and come and ſtand before me in this houſe, whereupon my name is called, &amp;c. Iere.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Doth not the Lord thereby teach vs, that the wicked ſhould not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance ſo much as once enter into the houſe of praier?</p>
               <p>In the ſeuenth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and words of our Sauiour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alledged, <hi>If ye that are euill can giue good things to your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that aske them, how much more ſhall your father in heauen giue good things to them that aske them:</hi> and in the preface to the forme of praier preſcribed by our Sauiour; <hi>Our father which art in heauen, Mat.</hi> 6. 9. doth not our Sauiour teach vs, that praier belongeth only to the children of God, that may call God <hi>their father?</hi> doth not the Apoſtle likewiſe teach the ſame, when he ſaith that <hi>We haue receiued the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba father? Rom.</hi> 8 15.</p>
               <p>We may alſo obſerue that the Apoſtles doe ſeldome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <note place="margin">Note.</note> praier but in the latter end of their Epiſtles, after they haue taught God to bee the Father of them to whom they write, and them to behaue themſelues like children towards God, as <hi>Rom</hi> 15. 30. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 4. 2. 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 17. 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18.</p>
               <p>So alſo the Prophets do ſeldome exhort to praier, but after their exhortations to repentance, and to the honoring of God as a father: <hi>Hoſe</hi> 14. 2. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 13. and 17.</p>
               <p>At the leaſt the Prophets and Apoſtles do ioine ſeeking of God <hi>whiles he is neere, and calling vpon him whiles hee may be found,</hi> with exhortations for the wicked <hi>to forſake his waies and the vnrighteous his owne imaginations, and to returne to the Lord,</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:18428:129"/> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 6. 7. and <hi>drawing neere to God with hearts ſprinkled from an euill conſcience, and bodies waſhed with pure water,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. and <hi>with cleanſing of hands, and purging of hearts, Iames</hi> 4. 8. So it is alſo ſaid, <hi>Let euery one that calleth on the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>As all commandements for praying doe thus belong onely to the children of God, ſo all commendations of praier are only of the praiers of <hi>faith, and of the righteous, Iames</hi> 5. 15. and 16. and <hi>of the Saints, Reu.</hi> 5. 8. Therefore alſo the blinde man whoſe eies Chriſt had opened, ſaith of the praiers both of <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and alſo <hi>of the worſhippers of God, We know that God heareth not ſinners, but if any man bee a worſhipper of God, and doe his will, him heareth he: Ioh.</hi> 9. 31. The Prophet ſaith, <hi>If I regard wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe in my heart, the Lord will not heare me: Pſal.</hi> 66. 18. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is abomination to the Lord: but the praier of the righteous is acceptable vnto him: Prou.</hi> 15. 8. And againe, <hi>The Lord is farre off from the wicked: but he heareth the praier of the righteous:</hi> verſ. 29. And againe, <hi>He that turneth away his eare from hearing the Law, euen his praier ſhall be abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: Pro.</hi> 28. 9.</p>
               <p>As I haue ſhewed by diuers examples before how accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the praiers of Gods children are vnto him: ſo I might by diuers examples ſhew how the Lord hath reiected the praiers of the wicked from time to time: not only of the Iewes, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we heard at <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> firſt prophecying, and in the daies of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> but alſo afterward, as appeareth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 3. &amp;c. and 59. 1. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 14. 12. <hi>Eze.</hi> 14. 1. &amp;c. and 20. 3. &amp;c. and of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites long before, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 10. 10. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That ſometimes God hath heard the praiers of ſome wicked men, it is either becauſe ſome of his children haue ioined in ſuch praiers, or becauſe the things granted by the Lord haue as much concerned ſome of his children, as them that haue made ſuch praiers: or that by hearing ſo the wicked, he may either breake their hearts, or make them the more inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, let vs vnderſtand concerning praier, that thereby the children of God haue not onely a priuilege, in that they may come themſelues to make their owne
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:18428:130"/> praiers vnto God: but alſo in that they are likewiſe partaker of the praiers of one another. Euery child of God through the world, is partaker of all the common praiers of all the children of God liuing vpon the earth whereſoeuer diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. No man at any time in faith and truth praieth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the forme of praier preſcribed by our Sauiour, but that therein he commendeth vnto God, all the members of Chriſt liuing vpon the earth: and that may as well as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>call God their Father which is in heauen.</hi> They that are dead (as before wee haue heard) haue no need of the praiers of the liuing; neither any benefit by ſuch praiers: yet the liuing haue very great neede of the praiers one of another; and haue alſo great benefit by ſuch praiers: Eſpecially ſuch as are ſpecially and particularly by name ſo commended to God by other, haue the more ſpeciall benefit by ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. Yea not onely haue the meaneſt of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren much benefit by the praiers of them that are of the greateſt faith, zeale, and godlineſſe: but they that haue the greateſt meaſure of faith, zeale, and godlineſſe haue helpe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo and benefit, by the praiers of the meaneſt and weakeſt. Therefore as all the Iſraelites fearing death both for their owne ſinnes, and alſo for their asking a King, did earneſtly <hi>intreat Samuel to pray for them,</hi> leſt (according to their feare) <hi>they died</hi> 1. <hi>Sam</hi> 12. 19. So <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe doth often very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly craue the praiers of all thoſe to whom he did write, of poore and rich, of great and ſmall that did beleeue: as <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 30. <hi>Epheſ</hi> 6. 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in other places before alledged. Yea, he hoped for great comfort by their ſuch praiers: <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Philem.</hi> 22. If it be a great benefit to haue a good friend for furtherance of our ſutes to mortall Princes, is it not much more for euery child of God to haue all the reſt of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren on earth (ſpeciall fauorites with God) to be furtherances of their ſutes vnto him? Verily though a man deſpaire of his own praiers, yet might he haue exceeding comfort in the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all the reſt of Gods children. This ſhall ſuffice to haue ſpoken of the prerogatiue of Gods children, both by their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and boldneſſe for making their own praiers to God: and alſo by that, that other, yea all other of Gods children do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:18428:130"/> them: euen euery one another, ſo often as they pray to God themſelues.</p>

For firſt of all, this name Chriſt, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the whole body of the Church, whereof euery true child of God is a member: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. And therefore Chriſt doth profeſſe that whatſoeuer (good or euill) is done vnto any that are ingrafted into him is done vnto himſelfe: <hi>Matthew</hi> 25. 40. and 45. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4.

                  </gap>6. ſo they may alſo euery one of them bee called, petty Chriſts, or little Chriſts: becauſe as the word Chriſt ſignifieth nothing elſe but annointed, and as Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to be anointed with the oyle of gladneſſe aboue his fellowes: Pſal.</hi> 45. 7. ſo it is ſaid of euery one of vs that are his members, <hi>that the anointing which we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of him dwelleth in vs: and that we need not that any man teach vs, but as the ſame anointing teacheth vs all things: 1.

               <p>Neither is this name only, Chriſt, thus communicated to the children of God, but alſo the name Ieſus touching the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18428:131"/> thereof. For what doth it ſignifie but a Sauiour? So the Angell himſelfe interpreteth it, <hi>Thou ſhalt</hi> (ſaith hee to <hi>Mary) call his name Ieſus, for he ſhall ſaue his people from their ſinnes: Mat.</hi> 1. 21. Now it is not onely ſaid to <hi>Timothie</hi> (and in him to all miniſters of the word) <hi>that by taking heede to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and to learning, and by continuing therein, hee ſhould ſaue himſelfe and other:</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. but it is alſo ſaid of all other the children of God, that by <hi>praier, inſtruction, admonition, &amp;c.</hi> ſhall conuert <hi>a ſinner from going aſtray out of the way, that they ſhall ſaue a ſoule from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſinnes: Iames</hi> 5. 20. So likewiſe <hi>Iude</hi> writing to all ſorts, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Miniſters but other, exhorteth them <hi>to haue compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on ſome, in putting difference, and to ſaue other with feare, pulling them out of the fire, &amp;c. Iude.</hi> 22. 23. Doth not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle by theſe words inſinuate that they that ſhall ſo ſaue other (though it bee with feare) may in that reſpect bee called a Ieſus or a Sauiour inſtrumentally? The name <hi>Ioſhua</hi> in ſignification is all one with Ieſus, and therefore <hi>Ioſhua</hi> is called Ieſus: <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 45. becauſe by ſauing the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from their bodily enemies, hee was a type of Chriſt Ieſus that ſhould ſaue his people from their ſpirituall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. If therefore <hi>Ioſhua</hi> were ſo called in that typicall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: why may not they bee ſo called, that are the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt Ieſus, to ſaue men from their ſinnes, and ſo conſequently from euerlaſting damnation? Againe, as Chriſt is called <hi>the firſt fruits of the dead:</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20. and as in a typicall reſpect of Chriſt, all the firſt borne of cleane li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures, &amp; al the firſt fruits of other things, were in the law, and by the law dedicated and conſecrated vnto God: ſo the Iewes in former times in reſpect of Gods ſpecial couenant with them: <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 3. and much more now <hi>all whom God of his owne will hath begotten againe with the word of truth,</hi> are called by the name of <hi>the firſt fruits of God: Iames</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Reu.</hi> 14. 4. As Chriſt is called <hi>a King and a Priest:</hi> ſo likewiſe it is ſaid, <hi>that he hath made vs vnto God Kings and Prieſts: Reu.</hi> 1. 6. and 5. 10. wherewith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> accordeth, ſaying, that <hi>wee are a roial Prieſthood:</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. which is al one with that which the Lord ſaith by <hi>Moſes</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (in that reſpect wherein
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:18428:131"/> before wee heard the Iewes to be called <hi>the Lords firſt fruits)</hi> that <hi>if they would indeed heare his voice, and keepe his Couenant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then they ſhould bee his chiefe treaſure, and a kingdome of Prieſts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 6.</p>
               <p>And indeed (touching theſe two attributes) how can wee but bee Kings and Prieſts, being incorporated into him, and made one with him, to whom moſt properly and principally the ſaid two attributes doe belong?</p>
               <p>More particularly (to begin firſt with the laſt) we are Prieſts, firſt <hi>in offring vp our bodies</hi> (that is, our whole ſelues) <hi>a liuing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto God, holy and acceptable,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. and that firſt by crucifying the old man, and letting out the blood of our ſinnes (which is the life of our ſaid old man) and then by ſeaſoning our ſelues with the gracious word of God, as ſome ſacrifices were ſeaſoned with ſalt, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 2. 13. and as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle requireth our <hi>ſpeech to be ſeaſoned, Coloſ</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee are called Prieſts for our offring vp to God <hi>the calues of our lips, Hoſ.</hi> 14. 3. and <hi>the ſpirituall ſacrifices,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. both of Praiers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141. 2. and <hi>of Praiſes, Pſalm.</hi> 50. 14. and 23. as alſo <hi>of doing good and diſtributing, Heb.</hi> 13. 16. and of other duties <hi>of righteouſneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee are called Prieſts, not onely in reſpect of the former ſacrifices, but alſo becauſe if need require, we muſt be ready to giue our liues for Gods glory, and for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the faith of other, which is that which the Apoſtle meaneth by being <hi>offred vp vpon the ſacrifice and ſeruice of the faith of Gods elect: Phil.</hi> 2. 17. According to which phraſe alſo the Apoſtle ſaith againe, that <hi>hee was ready to be offred,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6. whereby he meaneth the violent death that afterward he was to ſuffer for the credit of his doctrine, and the better ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vp the truth thereof in the conſciences of thoſe that had either heard his preaching or read his writings. So to die for the truth, is a ſacrifice, not propitiatorie and meritorious (as the Papiſts blaſphemouſly teach) but partly euchariſticall and of thankſgiuing, and partly for the confirming and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of other in that truth which they ſee other to bee ready to ſeale with their blood, and much more to eſteeme the ſame then they doe their owne liues.</p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:18428:132"/>
               <p>Fourthly we are ſaid by Chriſt to be made Prieſts, becauſe as the Prieſts duty of the law was not onely to offer ſacrifice, but <hi>alſo to teach the people the difference between the holy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, &amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 44. 23. in which reſpect it is alſo ſaid that <hi>the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerue knowledge, and that the people ſhould ſeeke the law out of his mouth: Malac.</hi> 2. 7. ſo all the children of God are (in theſe daies eſpecially of the Goſpell: <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 28.) <hi>to abound more and more in knowledge and in all iudgement, that they may be able to diſcerne things that differ: Phil.</hi> 1. 9. 10. and <hi>to haue the word of Chriſt dwelling more plentifully in them in all wiſedome: Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 16. and ſo alſo <hi>the better not</hi> onely <hi>to try all things:</hi> 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>euen the ſpirits whether they be of God or no:</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 1. but alſo to <hi>exhort one another daily whiles it is called to day, leſt any</hi> (by neglect of this duty) <hi>be hardned through the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne: Heb.</hi> 3. 13. and 10. 25. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 16. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Iude</hi> 20. And in this reſpect alſo, as Chriſt is called a Prophet, ſo for that mutuall duty of teaching, admoniſhing, exhorting, and edifying one another (in the places laſt before alledged, commended to all the children of God) they may all not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly be called by the name of Prophets. Eſpecially becauſe, as notwithſtanding teaching belonged (as we haue heard) to the Prieſts, yet Prophets were extraordinarily for the moſt part raiſed vp, when the prieſts began to neglect their duty in that behalfe: ſo in theſe daies the ordinary miniſters too much neglecting their duty of publike teaching, the Lord will haue all men the more diligent in the priuate performance of thoſe duties before mentioned, and for that reſpect (in ſome ſort) to performe the duty of ancient prophets.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding euen this propheticall duty I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend vnder the prieſthood of Gods children, as ſome learned of late times haue alſo comprehended the propheticall office of Chriſt, vnder his prieſthood, as a part thereof.</p>
               <p>To returne therefore vnto, or to dwell a little longer in the Prieſthood which the children of God haue by the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt, the ſame is the more to be conſidered, becauſe of the generality thereof. In the time of the law, the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the law was reſtrained. Firſt to one ſex, viz. only to the males. Secondly to one age at which it ſhould begin, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18428:132"/> at which it ſhould end touching the neceſſary execution of their office, at leaſt, of one part thereof for the offering of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. Thirdly to one tribe, the tribe of <hi>Leui.</hi> Fourthly to one family: the family of <hi>Kohath</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Leui.</hi> Fiftly to one houſe of that family, to the poſterity of <hi>Amran</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Kohath: Exod.</hi> 6. 18. and 20. Sixtly, to one of the ſonnes of <hi>Amran:</hi> to <hi>Aaron</hi> and to his poſterity for euer: <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 1. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 10. and 18. 7. Seuenthly, touching ſome ſpeciall offices of the prieſthood, to one only place, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainetimes: yea, for the high prieſt to enter into the moſt holy place at one time only of the yeere: <hi>Heb</hi> 9. 7. and for other to performe their duties by courſe: <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 8. Eightly, that prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood had an end at the comming of Chriſt in Chriſt himſelfe. Thus we ſee within what limits the prieſthood of the law was ranged, and reſtrained. But this prieſthood whereof now we ſpeake, is common to all the children of God, of all ſexes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and times: yea, it was in the time of the law, though made more manifeſt in the time of the Goſpell. It may be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in all places: and at all times: not only with company, but by euery one alone: yea it ſhall continue to the end of the world: yea as touching the offring of the ſacrifice of praiſe, it ſhall continue for euer, after the generall reſurrection, in the heauens themſelues.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the former prieſthood of the law was both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed and alſo ſeparated from the ciuill magiſtracie: ſo that the King might not be Prieſt, neither execute the Prieſts office. Therefore it is ſaid that <hi>the heart of Vzziah was lift vp within him, when he entred into the temple of the Lord, to burne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe vpon the altar of incenſe. And that Azariah the Prieſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him, and told him that it pertained not vnto him to burne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to the Lord, but to the Prieſts the ſonnes of Aaron: and that therefore the Lord immediatly ſmot him with leproſie, &amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither alſo might the Prieſt take vpon him the office of the king, or of any ciuill magiſtrate (except it were extraordinarily: 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 8.) becauſe as <hi>thoſe things that God had coupled, no man might put a ſunder: Mat.</hi> 19. 6. ſo thoſe things that God had ſeparated, no man might ioine together. Yea, the reſt of the Leuites, that had the charge of the tabernacle
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18428:133"/> and of things pertaining thereunto, might not meddle with the works of the prieſthood: <hi>Num.</hi> 18. 3. except only extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, and in the caſe of neceſſity, <hi>when there were noe prieſts enow ſanctified for the works of the Prieſthood:</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 34. But touching this prieſthood now ſpoken of, kings may and muſt execute the office thereof as well as ſubiects: yea Kings and Queens with all their royall poſterity, are and muſt bee Prieſts in this manner. If they ſhould diſdaine this name, they muſt alſo renounce the title of the children of God, which is greater then the title of earthly King or Queene, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the excellency of the prieſthood of all the ſons and daughters of God by Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>Honorable was the prieſthood of the law, yea ſo honorable that <hi>Iehoſhebeth</hi> daughter of king <hi>Iehoram,</hi> grand child of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat,</hi> ſiſter of king <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> and aunt of king <hi>Ioaſh, was wife to Iehoiada the Priest:</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 11. So honorable alſo, that <hi>Vzziah</hi> king of <hi>Iudah</hi> not contented with his kingly ſtate (as we haue heard) did aſpire to the prieſtly dignity. Would kings haue married their daughters to Prieſts? Would kings haue bin ambitious for the prieſtly dignity, if they had not thought very honorably of that calling? How honorable then is the prieſthood of the children of God by Ieſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>As the children of God haue Chriſts name of Prieſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto them, and are by Chriſt made Prieſts vnto God: ſo are they kings likewiſe vnto God: and that euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſons or children of God. For as ſometimes all the ſonnes of ſome Emperors (which haue had their Empires by inheritance, not by election) are borne kings, or at leaſt haue been left kings by their Fathers, or haue had ſuch duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes as haue had kingly power, and kingly dignities (the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle only of kings excepted) and as in ſome countries at this day, all the ſonnes of an Earle are Earles: ſo likewiſe al the ſons and children of God the Emperor of all the world, (being eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially incorporated and ingrafted to the proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſonne of God, and made one with him) may in that reſpect not vnfitly be called kings.</p>
               <p>But what is the kingly power, and what be the kingly dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18428:133"/> of the children of God? Verily, their power by Ieſus Chriſt and through faith in him is very great: yea farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the power of any worldly king whatſoeuer. For of what king in the world (as he is onely a worldly King) can that be ſaid, that is ſaid by him that is truth it ſelfe, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that hath faith <hi>but as a graine of muſtard ſeede:</hi> viz. that <hi>nothing is impoſſible vnto him? Matthew</hi> 17. 20. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>All things are poſſible to him that beleeueth: Mark.</hi> 9. 23. What earthly King alſo (as he is only an earthly King) can ſay of himſelfe, as poore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaide of himſelfe by that <hi>Spirit, that cannot lye, I am able to doe all things by the helpe of Chriſt which ſtrengthneth me? Philip.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuch as the power of the children of God is, ſuch alſo is their heart and courage, namely altogether princely: yea much more then princely. For who but the child of God can ſay, <hi>Though I ſhould walke through the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of the ſhadow of death, I will feare no euill? Pſal.</hi> 23. 4. and againe, <hi>I will not bee afraide, though ten thouſand beſet mee round about: Pſalme</hi> 3. 6. and againe, <hi>Though an hoſt pitched againſt mee, mine heart ſhould not be afraid: Pſal.</hi> 27. 3. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>I will not feare, what fleſh can doe vnto mee? Pſalme</hi> 55. 4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, according to the former princely power and magnanimitie of the children of God, their effects are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe princely and ſutable to their ſaid power and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: For (to omit in this place thoſe great mighty effects of the praiers of Gods children before mentioned) whereas by nature they are ſeruants and bondmen to ſatan, to their owne wicked luſts, and to euery worldly vanity, as well as any other: after that they are partaker of the ſpirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, they are ſo armed alſo <hi>With weapons that are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, but mighty through God, that they caſt downe all the ſtrong holdes of ſinne in them:</hi> 2. <hi>Corinthians</hi> 10. 4. which are ſtronger then all Caſtles and defenced Cities whatſoeuer. Yea hauing put on all the ſpirituall armour <hi>Whereby they wreſtle not with fleſh and bloud, but with principalities and powers, and worldly gouernors, Princes of darkneſſe, &amp;c. Epheſ.</hi>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:18428:134"/> 6. 12. <hi>they ouercome all theſe, they raigne ouer all, and through him that loued them, they are more then conquerors: ſo that neither Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be euer able to ſeparate them from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> to deiect them from that excellent ſtate, whereunto Chriſt Ieſus hath aduanced them: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is not only ſaid, that <hi>by faith they ouercome the world</hi> (that is, the things of this viſible world, that do any waies hinder their ſaluation) but ſatan himſelfe alſo is ſo by Chriſt Ieſus ſubdued vnto them; and (in a manner) brought into ſuch feare of them, that they doe no ſooner turne their face vpon him and <hi>reſiſt him,</hi> but that preſently <hi>he flieth from them,</hi> and as it were taketh him to his heeles, as not able to abide their countenance: <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 7. O noble victory! O glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt! All the great conquerors in the world (how renoumed ſoeuer for their worldly victories) neuer got the like. Yea all kings and Princes and other conquerors that are not in Chriſt Ieſus, are as very ſlaues to ſatan, to the world, and <hi>to all luſts of the fleſh which fight againſt their ſoules:</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. as euer was <hi>Samſon</hi> to the Philiſtims, when they put out both his eies, and made him to grind in the mill: <hi>Iudg.</hi> 16. 21. or as <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was when he was taken by <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> before whoſe eies they firſt ſlew all his ſonnes, and then put out his owne eies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and bound him in chaines, and ſo carried him to <hi>Babel:</hi> 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 25. 7. or finally as any captiue or ſlaue now is, either in the Turks Gallies, or in ſubiection to the Spaniard in the Weſt Indies, or els where. Yea, for the moſt part, ſuch great champions and captaines, and conquerors touching fleſh and bloud, are of all other the moſt ſlaues, moſt cowards, and ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ouercome by euery luſt. But ſo to ouercome ſuch luſts, and other enemies of ſaluation, is more then in a carnall and outward manner with the arme of fleſh to ouercome the whole world: yea, if there were many worlds; yet for a man to ouercome himſelfe, with ſatan and the world, is more then to ouercome them all. <hi>He that ruleth his owne mind, is better then he that winneth a city: Pro.</hi> 16. 32. What is he then, that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth himſelfe, and the whole power of hell?</p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:18428:134"/>
               <p>Moreouer, euen touching the arme of fleſh and worldly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, greater is the power oft times and courage of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God in reſiſting and ouercomming of them, then of all the wicked in the world. Yea, in this reſpect the children of God haue true fortitude and magnanimity beſeeming Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For theſe ſentences before alledged of <hi>Dauids</hi> feareleſſe heart, are not ſpoken in reſpect of his ſpirituall enemies, but in reſpect of his outward aduerſaries. And what victories are comparable to the victories of <hi>Ioſhua, Gedeon, Iephte, Samſon, Ionathan, Dauid,</hi> and other ſuch worthies mentioned in the ſcripture? All wicked and meere naturall men are void of the ſpirit of true fortitude, euen for withſtanding and ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming bodily enemies: how then can they haue true fortitude it ſelfe?</p>
               <p>The foreſaid more then kingly power and courage of the children of God, is apparant likewiſe by other effects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſeem moſt cowardly: euen by all the reproches, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies, wrongs and indignities, which they put vp patiently at the hands of the wicked, as diſdaining to reſiſt them, as not being their equals. As noble men diſdaine and ſcorne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with baſe perſons, and ſuch as are much their inferiors; and as all men would thinke it and might thinke it a diſgrace vnto them to fight with boies, though neuer ſo much abuſing them: ſo is the mind and courage of the children of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the wicked in the world, who are indeed no better to be accounted of in compariſon of them, then as baſe and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect perſons: much more may they be no more eſteemed then boies or children.</p>
               <p>The ſuffering alſo the loſſe of all that they haue in the world, and of the world, and the ſubmitting themſelues to the moſt ſhamefull death that is for Chriſts ſake, that died the curſed death of the croſſe for them, what doth it declare but that they haue that noble mind for the contemning of the world, and all that is therein, that was in Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, <hi>Who for the ioy that was ſet before him is ſaid to haue endured the Croſſe, and deſpiſed the ſhame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heb.</hi> 12. 2. What is more princely and kingly then this? If it be alſo accounted fortitude for the common ſouldier to follow his captaine, and to aduenture
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:18428:135"/> any danger (though it be with loſſe of life) wherein he hath ſeene his Captaine goe before him: ſhall wee not account it fortitude likewiſe, for the children of God to endanger and to loſe their liues in ſuch things, as wherein Chriſt Ieſus their chiefe Captaine hath gone before them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>To proceed yet further in the conſideration of the Kingly dignity of Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let this be our fourth meditation in that behalfe, that whereas by nature through our foreſaid bondage to ſinne and Satan, and to euery wordly vanity, wee were alſo captiues vnto death it ſelfe, and priſoners of hell, and in the ſtate of condemnation, now being made the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God and members of Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>God hath giuen vs ſuch victory through our ſaid Lord Ieſus Chriſt: Rom.</hi> 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>5. that we may victoriouſly triumph ouer death, hell, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſaying, <hi>Death is ſwallowed vp in victory. O death where is thy ſting? O graue where is thy victory?</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Now there is no condemnation to vs that are in Chriſt Ieſus: Rom.</hi> 8. 1.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, as Kings that haue power and courage doe protect and defend their ſubiects from forraine powers, ſo alſo the children of God doe valiantly protect, and defend thoſe that are committed to their charge, againſt all the enemies of their ſaluation: except themſelues doe cowardly and ſlauiſhly run vnto them: or will not be releaſed from that bondage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by nature they are.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, as when God the father ſet Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>his King vpon Sion his holy mountaine</hi> (that is, ouer his Church) <hi>he gaue him</hi> (vpon his asking) <hi>the heathen for his inheritance, and the ends of the earth for his poſſesſion,</hi> euen, <hi>to cruſh them with a ſcepter of iron, and to breake them in peeces like a potters veſſell: Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. ſo alſo the children of God hauing Chriſt Ieſus <hi>the heire of all things: Heb.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>all</hi> other <hi>things</hi> likewiſe are ſaid to be <hi>theirs:</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21. and <hi>they ſhall inherit all things: Reu.</hi> 21. 7. Yea Chriſt hath promiſed <hi>to giue them</hi> (and will giue them) <hi>power ouer nations, to rule them with a rod of iron, and to breake them in peeces like a potters veſſell: Reu.</hi> 2. 26. 27.</p>
               <p>Heereby therefore it is, that onely the children of God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by Ieſus Chriſt recouered that right vnto al the creaturs
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:18428:135"/> of God, which was loſt by <hi>Adam,</hi> and hauing likewiſe liberty now in the time of the goſpell to vſe al thoſe things which for the time of the law were reſtrained (that ſuch reſtraint of ſome things might be to the Church then, and to the Church alſo in theſe daies, a teſtimony and a witneſſe of the former loſſe of all things). Hereby (I ſay) it is, that only the children of God haue power with ſobriety, and without offence, according to their ability and beſeeming their calling, and with obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome other rules in the word, to vſe all the creatures of God freely to Gods glory, and to their comfort; not only for neceſſity, but alſo for their honeſt delight: For <hi>vnto the pure</hi> (only) <hi>are all</hi> (ſuch) <hi>things pure: but vnto them that are defiled and vnbeleeuing</hi> (that is, vnto all that are not the children of God) <hi>nothing is pure, but euen their minds and conſciences are defiled: Tit.</hi> 2. 15. But of this right of the children of God vnto all things, more afterward.</p>
               <p>Moreouer thereby alſo, howſoeuer the children of God are here for a time by their enemies, and the enemies of Chriſt Ieſus moleſted and vexed, yet the time ſhall come, when all ſuch enemies ſhall bee fully ſubdued vnto them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as a pot broken in peeces by the potter: yea, they ſhall bee indeed broken in peeces, by Chriſt Ieſus the head of all the children of God: and that which is done by him being their head, ſhall bee accounted as done by them: yea, euen as the head doth vſe the hands and other parts of the body for executing what it ſelfe ſhall thinke good againſt all the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries thereof, and of the whole body; ſo ſhall Chriſt Ieſus vſe the members of his Church, not onely by the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall and ſpirituall power and cenſures thereof to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them that ſhall be of heatheniſh conditions and behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our amongſt them, <hi>and to binde their Kings with chaines, and their Nobles with fetters of yron,</hi> that is, by excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and ſuch other like ſeuere courſes, to make ſuch as were as Kings and captaines in all euill, to ſtoope, and bend, as if they were bound with chaines, and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of yron: <hi>Pſalme</hi> 149. 7. 8. not onely (I ſay) ſhall Chriſt thus vſe the members of his Church, to bridle and ſubdue the wicked, but alſo hee ſhall vſe Chriſtian

               <p>Eſpecially Chriſt Ieſus ſhall vſe ſuch chriſtian Kings and Princes, and ſome other alſo to ioine with them (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in worldly reſpects, and in deſire of the ſpoile) in hatred <hi>of the whore of Babylon,</hi> euen of Antichriſt the Pope, and of all that ſhall take his part (Princes as well as other) euen to <hi>make them deſolate and naked, and</hi> (as it were) <hi>to eat their fleſh, and to burne them with fire: Reuel.</hi> 17. 16.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, touching other princely vertues, as kings are to be amiable and courteous to the good, and auſtere and ſeuere to the wicked, ſo the children of God are indued with this kingly grace. <hi>A vile perſon is contemptible in their eies, but they honor them that feare the Lord: Pſal.</hi> 15 4. <hi>All their delight is in the Saints, and in them that are excellent vpon the earth: Pſal.</hi> 16. 3. <hi>but they haunt not with vaine perſons, neither keepe company with the diſſemblers, but hate the aſſembly of the wicked: Pſal.</hi> 26. 4. 5.

Yea, this they ſhall doe, not only becauſe they being members of Chriſt, and Chriſt being their head, therefore the ſentence of Chriſt ſhall be their ſentence: but alſo becauſe, as they haue been before accuſed by the world to the Iudges of the world, ſo at that time (euen at the great iudgement day) they ſhall be accuſers of their wrongfull accuſers, and of their vnrighteous Iudges to the moſt Iuſt iudge of all: who ſhall proceed to iudgement and ſentence againſt their former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers and Iudges, according to their accuſation of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented vnto him. And laſtly the iudgement and ſentence ſo giuen by Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, ſhall bee ratified by all the ſaints, the children of God.</p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:18428:137"/>
               <p>Ninthly, finally all the children of God are by Chriſt Ieſus ſaid to be made kings, becauſe as they in kingly manner are richly and ſumptuouſly apparrelled, hauing put on Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus himſelfe with his princely robe of righteouſneſſe, and with the whole new man, being both glorious within by their faith, loue, hope, patience, humility, &amp;c. and beautifull alſo outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by thoſe fruits of righteouſneſſe before ſpoken of: and as they fare roially euery day, hauing the dainty diet that hath been before alſo mentioned; ſo alſo at the laſt they ſhall as kings be crowned with crownes of gold: <hi>Reuel.</hi> 4. 4. yea, with better then gold, euen with the crowne <hi>of righteouſneſſe:</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>with the crowne of life: Iames</hi> 1. 12. <hi>with the crowne of glorie:</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4 In reſpect of this crowne, belonging to the leaſt of Gods children, all the crownes of all the Princes in the world (yea, put in alſo the triple crowne of the man of ſinne, the Pope of Rome, though he be more fit to be reckoned among the ſonnes of fooles, and of villaines, and bee not worthy to ſit with the dogs of the flockes of other Princes, much leſſe is he worthy to be named among them) In reſpect (I ſay) of this crowne thus belonging to the pooreſt ſonne and daughter of God, all the crownes of all the Princes in the world, are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the crowne of thornes which the ſouldiers in deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on put vpon the head of Chriſt Ieſus: <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 29. and the which Chriſt Ieſus did patiently weare, the better to purchaſe the foreſaid crowne of <hi>righteouſneſſe, life, and glory,</hi> for euery one of the children of God.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point, becauſe it is not <hi>decorum</hi> and fit for Princes that in their minority are clothed and fed ſo roially, and afterward crowned ſo gloriouſly, to ſtand, therefore alſo they ſhall haue a throne far more ſtately, then euer was the throne of <hi>Salomon,</hi> though it were made of <hi>yuory, and couered with the beſt gold, hauing ſix ſteps,</hi> and the ſimilitude <hi>of twelue ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vpon the ſaid ſteps,</hi> ſo that there was <hi>not the like throne in any kingdome:</hi> 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This throne is the throne of Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe; For ſo himſelfe ſaith, that <hi>He will giue vnto them to ſit with him in his throne, as himſelfe ſitteth in the throne of his father: Reu.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
               <p>By theſe things before ſpoken, eſpecially by ſome of them
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:18428:137"/> it appeareth, what great difference there is betwixt this kingly dignity of Gods children, and the kingly dignity of all earthly Kings and Princes. For whereas all earthly kings haue their kingdomes without them; the children of God haue theirs as well within them as without them: Whereas earthly Kings haue earthly iewels and earthly apparrell, and earthly crownes, made of earthen matter, ſuch as come from the earth; the children of God haue their robes, their iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and their crownes from heauenly places, and of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly matter. Whereas earthly kings are robed and decked with iewels, as alſo crowned by their ſubiects, that are baſe in reſpect of themſelues; the children of God are robed, dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and crowned by him that is himſelfe the Lord of Lords, the King of kings, the God of Gods, and the King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p>Whereas earthly kingdomes are peculiar but to one of the kings children; and that to a ſonne, though there bee but one; and none of the daughters, ſo long as there are heires male aliue, haue any part though they bee many: the children of GOD (both ſonnes, and daughters) are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of this kingdome by Chriſt Ieſus, whereof now wee treat.</p>
               <p>Whereas earthly kingdomes are not enioied preſently vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the birth of the heires vnto them, but for the moſt part after the death of former Kings; this kingdome the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God enioy, and are in actuall poſſeſſion of it, as ſoone as they are begotten againe, and new borne children to God, and they haue the preſent poſſesſion of their kinglie dignitie euen heere on eath: <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 5. 10. according to that before ſaid in that behalfe. Whereas earthlie Kings and kingdomes are all momentanie, and but for a time, both the children of God, and alſo their kingdome, are euerlaſting and continue for euer, as he and his kingdome be, in whom they are Kings, and from whom they receiue their kingly dignity.</p>
               <p>Sith therefore the children of God are ſuch Kings, and haue ſuch kingdomes, how great is their dignity in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe?</p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:18428:138"/>
               <p>Amongſt other great things, that the Lord promiſeth vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> in making his couenant with him, this is one, <hi>that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Kings ſhould proceed of him: Geneſ.</hi> 17. 6. The like promiſe is renewed to <hi>Iaakob</hi> afterward: <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 35. 11. And what Kings were they, which God promiſeth ſhould come out of their loines? Surely earthly Kings. For though <hi>Abraham</hi> were the Father of the faithfull, yet that promiſe is rather an earthly then an heauenly promiſe. If God himſelfe then promiſed this as a great matter to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iaakob,</hi> that Kings, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen earthly kings, ſhould proceed of them, how great a thing is this that now wee ſpeake of concerning all the children of God? viz. that not ſome of them (as God is to be vnderſtood before to ſpeake, not of all, but only of ſome of the poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iaakob</hi> to be Kings) but all are Kings, and ſuch Kings, as before we haue ſpoken of? Verily ſo great and glorious is this their kingly dignity, that in reſpect thereof, all the kingly dignitie of the world is of no value. Yea, in reſpect of the kingdome of the children of God, all the kingdomes of the world ſeparated from it (though put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) are but as a little mole-hill, or a filthie dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill.</p>
               <p>In that reſpect alſo much better is the condition of the pooreſt child of God (though he be as poore as <hi>Lazarus</hi> that <hi>ſate at the rich mans gate, deſiring only to bee refreſhed with the crums</hi> (or ſcraps) <hi>that ſhould fall from his table: Luke</hi> 16. 21.) then of the greateſt potentate in the world, that is not parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of this kingly dignity. Yea, if the greateſt Monarch in the world (not being one of the children of God by regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) knew the kingly dignity of them and his owne wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtate, hee would change ſtates with them if hee might: and though he had a thouſand kingdomes beſides, he would giue them all for the one kingdome of the children of God, and giue alſo to boote, whatſoeuer hee had beſides, not to his ſhirt alone, but euen to his skinne. This ſhall ſuffice for Chriſts kingly title communicated to all the children of God: and for their great and honourable condition thereby. To proceed to other titles of Chriſt communicated to the children of God: as Chriſt is called the chiefe corner ſtone:
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18428:138"/> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 22. <hi>Mark.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 20. ſo alſo the children of God particularly and ſeuerally conſidered are called <hi>liuing ſtones:</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. as alſo <hi>Pillers in the Temple of God: Reuel.</hi> 3. 12. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which phraſe alſo <hi>Dauid</hi> praieth that the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Iſrael might be <hi>as the corner ſtones grauen</hi> (or carued) <hi>after the ſimilitude of a palace:</hi> that is, fitted for the making of a Palace: viz. for God himſelfe to dwell in: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 12. Iointly alſo conſidered, they are called in the former place of <hi>Peter a Spirituall houſe:</hi> yea, <hi>the Temple of God, euen of the liuing God, wherein God dwelleth and walketh:</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. and <hi>of the holy Ghoſt:</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. and therefore alſo of Chriſt himſelfe, who dwelleth <hi>by faith in their hearts: Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
               <p>How great this honor is, hath been ſhewed before, Chap. 16. yea, that it is the greater, becauſe the wicked are habitations and houſes of diuels and of all vncleane ſpirits: <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 44. Was it not a fearefull iudgement, and a moſt diſhonorable thing that the Lord threatneth the countries of the Aſſyrians, and of other enemies of the Church <hi>ſhould be forſaken, and be left to the fowles of the mountaines, and to the beaſts of the field, &amp;c. Iſai.</hi> 18. 6. and that <hi>Babel</hi> it ſelfe <hi>the glorie of kingdomes, the beautie and pride of the Chaldeans, ſhould bee a lodging for Ziim, Ohim, and Iim, and that Oſtriches ſhould dwell there, and Satyres ſhould dance there, and Dragons ſhould dwell in the Palaces thereof? Iſai</hi> 13. 21. 22. and <hi>Ieremy</hi> 51. 37. How much more diſhonorable then is it, that men at the firſt created according to Gods image, ſhould be habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for diuels? Is this diſhonourable, and ſhall it not then be honorable for men beeing new borne the children of GOD, to bee alſo the houſes and Temples of GOD? As Chriſt is called <hi>a graft growing out of the root of Dauid: Iſai.</hi> 11. 1. and <hi>a righteous branch: Ierem.</hi> 25. 5. and 33 15. So all that are incorporated into Chriſt, are called branches and grafts, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As Chriſt is called <hi>the light of men, and the true light that lightneth euerie man that commeth into the world: Iohn</hi> 1. 4. 5. 7. 8. 9. and <hi>the light of the world: Iohn</hi> 8. 12. and 9. 5. ſo it is ſaid, firſt of the Apoſtles and other Miniſters of the Goſpell,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:18428:139"/> that <hi>they are the light of the world?

               <p>As therefore it is a great honor for a ſubiect to be dignified by a King with ſome of the Kings owne kingly titles: ſo is it much more honor for the children of God to bee dignified with ſo many titles of Chriſt Ieſus. Thus much for the titles of Chriſt communicated vnto the children of God, and their great dignity thereby.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing in the former Chapter, by occaſion of the kingly dignity of Gods children, briefly mentioned the right of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God vnto all things of this life, (viz. in the ſixt reſpect, why they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Kings) but that place being not fit to handle the ſame any thing largely, it not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding being a matter of good importance, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of further conſideration, for the further ſetting forth of the dignity of Gods children, I will now returne thereunto, and ſpeake ſomewhat more plentifully thereof.</p>
               <p>Concerning therefore this life, let vs vnderſtand that the children of God haue a double prerogatiue aboue the wicked: Firſt immunity from all afflictions of this life, as they are euill and hurtfull: Secondly right and intereſt into all the bleſſings of this life, ſo farre foorth as they are any waies good for them.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt of theſe thus it is written, <hi>who ſo dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the ſecret of the moſt high, ſhall abide in the ſhaddow
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:18428:139"/> of the Almighty: Pſal.</hi> 91. 1. <hi>Surely hee will deliuer thee from the ſnare of the hunter, and from the noiſome peſtilence: Hee will couer thee vnder his wings, and thou ſhalt bee ſure vnder his feathers: his truth ſhall bee thy ſhield and buckler: Thou ſhalt not bee afraid of the feare of the night, nor of the arrow that flyeth by day.</hi> verſe 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For indeede that whole <hi>Pſalme</hi> is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially occupied in the argument of the ſafety of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as touching the euils of this life, and in declaring the contrary dangers of the wicked. The like promiſe for the children of God, is in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 97. <hi>Yee that loue the Lord hate euill: hee preſerueth the ſoules of his Saints: hee will deliuer them from the hand of the wicked:</hi> verſe 10. The whole 121. <hi>Pſalme</hi> is alſo of this argument: For there the Prophet aſſureth all the children of God, that the <hi>Lord will not ſuffer their foot to ſlip: that hee will ſo keepe them, that the Sunne ſhall not ſmite them by day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the Moone by night.</hi> Yea, hee ſaith, verſe 7. that <hi>the Lord ſhall preſerue them from all euill &amp;c.</hi> Yea, that <hi>he ſhall preſerue their going out, and their comming in.</hi> The ſame is likewiſe euident by the couenant that God maketh with all creatures, euen the fierceſt and cruelleſt, for his childrens ſake. But of this more afterward.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> alſo ſaith of the ſame point, <hi>But now thus ſaith the Lord that created thee, and hee that formed thee O Iſrael: feare not, for I haue redeemed thee: I haue called thee by thy name, thou art mine. When thou paſſeſt through the waters I will bee with thee, and through the floods that they doe not ouerflow thee: When thou walkeſt through the very fire, thou ſhalt not bee burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle vpon thee: Iſai.</hi> 43. 1. 2. What meaneth the Lord by theſe words, but that his children ſhould haue no hurt by thoſe things, that doe moſt deuoure and conſume other? I might adde many other Scriptures to the ſame purpoſe, but theſe ſhall be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Beſides thoſe and the like Scriptures and promiſes, the ſame is manifeſt by great reaſon: For ſith all the afflictions of this life are part of the curſe and puniſhment that is due to our ſinnes: and ſith Chriſt Ieſus tooke vpon him and came into the world to ſuffer the whole curſe
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:18428:140"/> of God, both of this life and of the life to come, that wee had deſerued; and <hi>hauing</hi> accordingly <hi>indeed borne our infirmities, and caried our ſorrowes, and was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and broken for our infirmities, and had the chaſtiſement of our peace vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: Iſai</hi> 53. 4. 5. <hi>and did himſelfe beare our ſinnes</hi> (that is the full puniſhment of our ſinnes) <hi>in his body on the tree:</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. therefore it ſtandeth no more with the iuſtice of God, to caſt ſuch afflictions vpon vs (as puniſhments of our ſinnes) then it agreeth with the iuſtice of man to receiue his debt of the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and yet after to require the ſame of the principall debter: or to puniſh him for not paying the ſame: yea, foraſmuch as the higher and greater any Iudge is, the more it behoueth him to doe iuſtice and iudgement, and ſith <hi>God is the Iudge of all the world: Geneſ.</hi> 18. 25. therefore if it agree not with the iuſtice of man, to demand that debt of one that is paied by another, much leſſe doth the like ſtand with the iuſtice of God.</p>
               <p>The former point is likewiſe manifeſt by many examples. <hi>Noah</hi> and a few of his, were kept in the great floud, that drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the world beſides.</p>

                  <hi>Ieremiah</hi> and <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> were well prouided for, and had great liberty, when the great nobles and Princes of Ieruſalem, with many other of the common people which before had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected the word of the Lord, were either cruelly put to the ſword, or ſlauiſhly carried away captiue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> was preſerued from the Aramites (though in great danger of them) when <hi>Ahab was</hi> wounded to death by them.</p>
               <p>The red ſea gaue way to the Iſraelites, and ſtood vpon heapes like a wall for their ſafe paſſage through it, when <hi>Pharao</hi> and all his hoſt were ouerwhelmed in it.</p>
               <p>Againe, to ſome ſpeciall ſinnes, there are ſome ſpeciall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions belonging. To drunkenneſſe belongeth <hi>woe, ſorrowes,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:18428:140"/> ſtrife, murmuring</hi> (or much talke) <hi>wounds without cauſe</hi> (or wounds without puniſhment) <hi>redneſſe of eies: Pro.</hi> 23. 29. So likewiſe to it, and to all other intemperancy, there belong ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noiſome diſeaſes, as the dropſie, the gout, apoplexies and ſuch like; yea, not only diſeaſes, but deformity alſo of body, blockiſhneſſe of wit, and dulneſſe of vnderſtanding (of how ſharpe wit, and quick capacity ſoeuer they were before) with hardneſſe of heart like to brawne, ſo that hauing many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, yet they ſhall feele none. Adultery likewiſe and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency is accompanied with ſome foule diſeaſes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other euils. Boldneſſe and raſhneſſe is not without many great dangers. To thoſe alſo, and to diuers other ſinnes belong pouerty, great ſhame, diſgrace, reproch, and contempt with men. The like may be ſaid of many other ſinnes, as hauing many ſpeciall calamities atten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing vpon them. For as much then as before we haue heard, that the children of God are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſuch ſins, it followeth likewiſe that they are the more ſafe from thoſe euils, that they doe ſpecially meet with, that fall into ſuch ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Thus much briefly for the immunity of the children of God from the euils of this life.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſecond ſort of benefits for this life belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the children of God, they are (as before I ſaid) all the bleſſings of this life, far foorth as they are good for them, and may be accounted benefits, not only in their own nature, but alſo to the children of God. Theſe are, length of daies, health, peace, ſafety, liberty, riches, credit, honors, authority, friends, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>All theſe do belong only to the children of God: and that by a double right. Firſt by promiſe: Secondly by participation of Chriſt, and that communion with him before handled: in whom all the promiſes of God belong vnto men, and are ſaid to be <hi>yea and Amen,</hi> that is, begun and accompliſhed. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
               <p>Touching the right of thoſe bleſſings by promiſe, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith that <hi>godlineſſe hath the promiſe not only of the life that is to come, but alſo of the life preſent:</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. If ye require where they are promiſed, looke theſe places ſpecially: <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. 3. to
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:18428:141"/> verſ. 14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 3. to verſe alſo 14. <hi>Iob.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 22. 23. <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> alſo 34. 9. it is ſaid that <hi>Nothing wanteth to them that feare God that the Lions do lacke and ſuffer hunger: but that they which ſeeke the Lord ſhall want nothing that is good.</hi> Many ſweet promiſes for this life, are likewiſe diſperſed throughout <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. See alſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 9. <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 81. 13. <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 112. 2. <hi>&amp;c. Prou.</hi> 24. 4 and many other places. For indeed the ſcripture is very rich in theſe promiſes for the children of God: but no where are the bleſſings of this life promiſed to the wicked: yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe in the former two firſt places: <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is a world of miſeries and outward cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities for this life threatned vnto them. The ſcripture likewiſe is full of ſuch threatnings elſewhere. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> thus deſcribeth the ſtate and portion of the wicked: <hi>He wandreth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to and fro for bread: and knoweth that the day of darkneſſe is prepared at hand</hi> (or rather, <hi>when he knoweth it to be prepared, the day of darkneſſe is at hand) affliction and anguiſh ſhall make him afraid: they ſhall preuaile againſt him, as a king ready to battell. For he hath ſtretched forth his hand againſt God, and made himſelfe ſtrong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Almighty. Therefore God ſhall run vpon him; euen vpon his necke, and againſt the most thicke part of his ſhield, &amp;c Though he dwell in deſolate places</hi> (ſuch as worldly men affect, to auoid reſort and expences by reſort) <hi>and in houſes which no man inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth, but are become heapes</hi> (ſuch alſo doe miſerable men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, that no man may haue any heart to come vnto them) <hi>he ſhall not be rich neither ſhall his ſubſtance continue: neither ſhall he prolong his perfection thereof in the earth. He ſhall neuer depart out of darkneſſe. The flame ſhall drie vp his branches: and he ſhall goe away with the breath of his mouth: Iob</hi> 15. 23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are many other the like places, containing the like threatnings: <hi>Iob</hi> 18. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 27. 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So then many euils of this life are threatned to the wicked: no good thing is promiſed vnto them as they are wicked.</p>
               <p>Indeed as <hi>Iehu</hi> (though a wicked man, and <hi>one that departed not from the ſinnes of Ieroboam that made Iſrael to ſinne:</hi> 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> 10. 31) as <hi>Iehu</hi> (I ſay) had in ſome things carried himſelfe like to the children of God, and had <hi>diligently executed that which was right in the Lords eies</hi> againſt the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> the Lord
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:18428:141"/> promiſed him (in the place alledged verſ. 30.) <hi>that his ſonnes to the fourth generation ſhould ſit vpon his throne:</hi> which we ſee to haue been performed Chap. 15 8.</p>
               <p>The like may bee ſaid of other wicked men touching the bleſſings of this life, that the Lord ſuffereth them to enioy them, and to haue the occupying of them for a time, (as in ſome other reſpects afterward to be ſpoken of, ſo alſo) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſome things done outwardly by them, whereby they doe ſomewhat reſemble his children: that ſo they may haue no cauſe to complaine of him, as of an hard Lord and maſter, but that all the world may ſee that hee <hi>rewardeth euerie man according to his worke.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. For as much then as God threatneth all euill to the wicked, and promiſeth nothing that good is vnto them as they are wicked, therefore alſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the promiſes of good things doe belong only to Gods children. And thus much for the firſt right of the children of God vnto the bleſſings of this life, viz. by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>Touching their ſecond right by communion with Chriſt, for as much as <hi>he is the only heire of all things: Heb.</hi> 1. 2. (as hath been before noted) and that, as he is not only God, but God and man (For euery heire is heire to another, but as Chriſt is <note place="margin">Note.</note> God, all things are his owne, and he hath equall right with the Father vnto all things, ſo that properly in that reſpect he is no heire) therefore it followeth that none can haue any intereſt to any thing, but only ſuch as are in Chriſt, and be members of his body. They that are Chriſts, and whoſe Chriſt himſelfe is, may well claime and challenge all other things: yea, they may aſſure themſelues, that they ſhall haue all other things. <hi>Hee that ſpared not his owne Sonne, but gaue him for vs all, how ſhall hee not with him</hi> (that is, it is not poſſible (as hath been before obſerued) but that with him he ſhould) <hi>giue vs all other things alſo Rom.</hi> 8. 32. Thus much briefly of the right that the children of God haue to all the blesſings of this life: neither only of their right, but alſo of their property in them. But yet I may not thus let this matter paſſe, without further ſpeech thereof, for the better ſatisfying of all men touching the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:18428:142"/>
               <p>To proceed therefore further therein, it may be demanded, and will (no doubt) be demanded, that if this be by promiſe, and by participation of Chriſt, the right and property of the children of God, why ſome of them, yea many of them, are oft times in great want and neceſſity. So was <hi>Bartimeus,</hi> that ſate <hi>by the high way begging: Mark.</hi> 10. 46. So was <hi>Lazarus, that lay at the rich mans gate: &amp;c. Luk.</hi> 16. 20. So <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he was anointed to be king of Iſrael, was in ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that he came to <hi>Ahimelech</hi> the Prieſt, to craue ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe for himſelfe and his company: and was glad to take the ſhew bread of the Lord, becauſe <hi>Ahimelech</hi> (though Prieſt) had then no other prouiſion ready: 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 3. Afterward alſo in the like neceſſity he ſent for ſome reliefe no <hi>Nabal:</hi> Chap. 25. 5. The like is the ſtate of many other; yea of moſt other the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. Their part oft times is but ſmall of theſe earthly bleſſings: It may therefore (I ſay) be demanded, why this is ſo: or how this ſtandeth with the righteouſneſſe of God to giue ſo little to them, to whom he hath promiſed ſo much: yea, who likewiſe by communion with Chriſt, haue right to all. To this I anſwer, that it is to be remembred, which before I ſaid, viz. that theſe bleſſings of this life are not abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the children of God, but conditionally, if they may be good for them, and no hinderances of them touching a better life: So only they are promiſed, and no otherwiſe: So only they may be praied for, and no otherwiſe: So only they may be looked for, and no otherwiſe: If they be otherwiſe praied for, or expected, our praier and expectation are wrong: and it skilleth not though we be not heard in our praier, and though our expectation be fruſtrated. Yea, it is better, we ſhould not be heard, and that our hope ſhould be fruſtrated, then otherwiſe. The wholſomeſt, the daintieſt, and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitly dreſt meat that is, may be hurtfull to a ſick and weake ſtomack: and though ſuch a ſick perſon doe craue ſuch meat, or any other that is good in it ſelfe, but not good for one ſicke of that diſeaſe, it is better not to giue it, then to giue it: and it is better for ſuch a ſicke perſon to want ſuch meat, then to haue it.</p>
               <p>As kniues likewiſe and ſwords are good in themſelues: yea,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:18428:142"/> the better the ſharper they bee: and yet not for children, or ſome other that know not how to vſe them: yea the ſharper and better, the more dangerous for ſuch perſons: ſo is it tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the blesſings of God for this life in reſpect of ſome of the children of God, to whom in reſpect either of ſome ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and weakneſſe, or of want of knowledge and diſcretion how to vſe them, they may be more dangerous many waies then profitable any waies. Yea the very beſt of Gods children may ſometime take hurt by many blesſings of this life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe in his proſperity <hi>ſaid he ſhould neuer be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: Pſal.</hi> 30. 6.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as the holy ghoſt had recorded the great riches, power and magnificence of <hi>Salomon:</hi> 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 10. in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the next Chapter he adioineth that <hi>he loued ſtrange wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> and that his ſaid <hi>ſtrange wiues turned his heart after ſtrange Gods, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Iehoſhaphat had riches and honey, then he ioined himſelfe in affinity with Ahab:</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was <hi>Hezekiah</hi> recouered of his ſickneſſe vnto death, but preſently <hi>his heart was lift vp within him.</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 25.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, as children may more eaſily hurt or breake a glaſſe, then be any thing the better if they haue it (although they take no hurt themſelues thereby) ſo ſome of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, by their childiſhneſſe <hi>in the grace and knowledge of God.</hi> may abuſe the blesſings of this life, albeit themſelues per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps take no apparant hurt by them.</p>
               <p>Againe, as it is not meet that euery naturall child of man, ſhould haue the like quantity of meat, or meat of the ſame ſort, or garments of the ſame meaſure, or of the ſame ſtuffe, <note place="margin">Note.</note> or of the ſame colour, becauſe there is difference of age, of ſtrength and of ſtature: ſo is it with the children of God tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the bleſſings of this life. A little is as ſufficient for ſome, as a great deale for other ſome: A little is as much for a meane man, as a great deale for a king or a noble man.</p>
               <p>If the Lord alſo giue a contented mind with a little, this is greater riches to one of Gods children, then a great deale with diſcontent, and a mind ſtill greedy of more, to the wicked.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:18428:143"/> Therefore <hi>godlineſſe</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>great gaine if a man be content with that he hath,</hi> or rather with a contented mind, to note an effect of godlineſſe, that it worketh a contented mind: or an adiunct of godlineſſe, that it is accompanied with a contented mind: 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6. But why is a little with a contented mind ſo great riches? Not onely becauſe whatſoeuer they haue, they haue right thereunto (as before hath been ſaid;) and becauſe that that they haue <hi>is pure vnto them, as</hi> themſelues <hi>are pure: Tit.</hi> 1. 15. but alſo becauſe they haue it with the fauour of God. <hi>He that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and receiueth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the Lord: Pro.</hi> 18. 20. That which is ſaid of finding a wife, may be ſaid of all other blesſings of this life to the children of God: They come from the fauour of the Lord; and are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the fauour of the Lord. Whether therefore they be few or many, ſmall or great, the godly may haue great comfort in them. Hence it is ſaid that <hi>A ſmall thing to the iuſt man is better then great riches to the wicked and mighty: Pſal.</hi> 37. 16. Many the like ſentences there are in the Prouerbs, as Chap. 15. 16. 17. and 16. 8. and 19. 8.</p>
               <p>As a little gift from a man with loue and good will, is more then a great deale by conſtraint of lawe, or of feare, or with grudging and murmuring, ſo certainly is it, touching the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God for this life beſtowed vpon the godly, with the fauour of God. Therefore we doe often ſee, that a godly man that hath but ſmall wealth fareth more merrily, and liueth more at hearts eaſe, quietly and comfortably; yea, and that he ſpendeth more vpon good vſes, then many wicked men, that haue ten times, yea twenty times as much as they, and yet leſſe charge alſo then they. As <hi>God giueth them all that they haue to enioy:</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. ſo they do enioy it to the comfort of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, of their wiues and children, of their other friends, and of the other Saints of God, ſtanding in need of comfort from them. And this mind thus to vſe the blesſings of this life, is much more then the blesſings themſelues. Sith therefore God doth giue a greater grace pertaining to the life to come vnto his children, to whom he giueth but a little for this life; which greater grace for the life to come is much more worth then all the abundance which they haue not for this life, God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:18428:143"/> be ſaid to be vnfaithfull touching his promiſe, as not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the ſame, neither can he be charged with any wrong done vnto the children of God, in giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo little for this life, becauſe he acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panieth that litle with ſo rich grace other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. He that promiſeth much of one kind, that is of ſmall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and giueth not the ſame, but a little of an other kind of far greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> worth then much of the meaner kind, doth he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wrong? Hee that promiſeth his ſonne twenty or thirty ſheepe, and giueth but ten, with fiue or ſixe good kine or ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, of more price then 40. ſheepe, doth he his ſon any wrong? or hath ſuch a ſonne, any cauſe to complaine of his Father?</p>
               <p>The former grace of a contented mind is the more, becauſe many a wicked man that hath great abundance, and no child or kinſman to inherit it, is neuer content: his eie is neuer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with riches, <hi>neither is there any end of his trauel:</hi> but his hart is alwaies troubled with cares and thoughts of the world: ſcarſe taking any quiet nights reſt, or eating his meat quietly: but alwaies <hi>eating the bread of ſorrow: Pſal.</hi> 127. 2. Yea, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill that himſelfe eateth too much, and ſtill crying out with <hi>the Horſleeches two daughters, Gine, Giue, and neuer ſaying, It is enough:</hi> and being of the nature of <hi>the graue, and barren wombe, that are nener ſatisfied: Prou.</hi> 30. 15. 16. As ſuch men are neuer quiet or ſatisfied in their minds, ſo in their bodies they are euer toiling and moiling, raking, ſcraping, and grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing in the earth, and about earthly matters, and for earthly &amp; earthen goods (himſelfe being more earthly and earthen then they) <hi>as if they had nothing at all:</hi> and as if whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that which they deſire, either they ſhould neuer loſe that, or that ſhould neuer loſe them. Such men hauing much in poſſeſſion, haue nothing in vſe: hauing all they are as poore as he that hath nothing. Of ſuch men ſpeaketh <hi>Salomon: Eccle.</hi> 4. 8. and 5. 9. and 6. 2.</p>
               <p>But as it is demanded and now anſwered, why the godly haue often times ſo ſmall a portion of theſe earthly bleſſings ſith they haue right vnto all, ſo it may likewiſe be demanded why the wicked haue ſo much, that haue no right to any thing To which that may ſerue for part of an anſwer that was ſaid laſt before, that although they haue much in poſſeſſion, yet they
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:18428:144"/> haue nothing in vſe, &amp;c. as alſo that before ſaid, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the wicked haue theſe outward bleſſings for ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſeruice, wherein they reſemble the children of God. But for further anſwer, to both the former comparatiue demands, touching the ſmall portion of the godly, and the great porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the wicked in theſe bleſſings of this life: we muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand another reaſon to bee this, that the Lord caſteth theſe mercies of this life, and diſperſeth and ſcattereth them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, as a man or woman doth ſometime throw downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their children and ſeruants a lap full, or basketfull of crabs, or ſome other baſe fruit: where he that is ſtrongeſt, and whoſe minde doth moſt affect ſuch baſe things, getteth the greateſt part, and they that are weake and whoſe ſtomacks care not for ſuch raw ſtuffe, get nothing at all, or very little. So (I ſay) the wicked being ſtrong in body, and minding altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther earthly things, by ſcambling, and ſtruggling, and ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping get much earthly muck: whereas the godly being for the moſt part of ſmall power, and little minding ſuch baſe things, but hauing their hearts ſet vpon better, <hi>euen vpon things that are aboue, where Chriſt Ieſus ſitteth at the right hand of God. Coloſ.</hi> 3. 1. and being alſo in that reſpect oft times very ſhiftleſſe for things of this life, they get but a little, and are content with a little, ſo that they haue enough for preſent neceſſity, and ſo that they grow rich in heauenly bleſſings.</p>
               <p>Againe, the great bleſſings of God for this life, beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wicked, are but as great paſture knee deepe for oxen fatted for the ſlaughter. Furthermore, all the right of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of this life, being only in the children of God (eſpecially in reſpect of God, and from God) whatſoeuer the wicked doe poſſeſſe, yet are they neuer the richer thereby. Nay, their ſtate is the worſe: not only becauſe thereby they are (as I ſaid) fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and made the fitter for Gods iudgements, but alſo becauſe in the end they ſhall giue account, as vſurpers of that which was not theirs. In the meane time they are no better then bankrupts, that haue great ſhops, vſe great dealings, and make many returnes, bearing great ſhewes, building goodly hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, furniſhing them richly, keeping great hoſpitality, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining themſelues and theirs in coſtly apparrell, in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:18428:144"/> ſpending with the beſt, &amp;c. but all of other mens goods, nothing of their owne. Theſe may flouriſh and bluſter for a time, and oftentimes ſo doe, as well as the wealthieſt: but when it is once known that they are worth nothing, but that they owe ten times more then all that they haue will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge; euery man then commeth vpon them thick and three fold: action followeth action: one arreſt after another: and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution vpon execution. And then (alas) what are they the better for all their former ſhewes, and flouriſhing brauery? yea, are they not in ten times more miſerable condition, then the poore man, that was not worth ſo much in all the world, as they ſometimes ſpent vainly in one weeke? For ſuch a man ſitteth ſtill, is quiet, and without interruption followeth his calling, when thoſe gallant fellowes are either in priſon, or lurking here and there, full of feare, and not daring to ſhew their faces, and when all that they had, is ſeazed to ſatiſfie their creditors.</p>
               <p>So is it with the wicked. Whatſoeuer they poſſeſſe; howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they ſwagger, and ruffle it out with their wealth, and other proſperity, bearing all downe before them: yet when God ſhall call them to account, then they ſhall find that they had no intereſt vnto any thing they poſſeſſed: becauſe they were without God, and without Chriſt in the world: and therefore that hauing much they had nothing. And then ſhall it be ten times worſe with them, then if they had had neuer a groat: yea, then ſhall they wiſh that they had had nothing, becauſe they ſhal be forced to giue an heauy reckoning of that which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intereſt they inioied, &amp; vſed, (or rather abuſed) at their pleaſure as if it had been their own: yea then ſhall they find to their great woe, that the pooreſt, and ſickeſt, and moſt deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble child of God, which liued alwaies in thraldome, bondage, and all other outward miſery, was (euen in the greateſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of that his miſery) in far more happy ſtate and condition then the greateſt, the richeſt, and the mightieſt noble man or King in all the world was, that was none of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, as before wee heard, that the children of God haue that which they haue (whether little or much) with the

As it is ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> that <hi>God gaue Iſrael a King in his anger: Hoſe.</hi> 13. 11. ſo it may be ſaid of all the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the wicked, that God doth giue it them in his anger. And how can it be otherwiſe, ſith they will not <hi>Kiſſe his ſonne,</hi> whom he hath commanded them <hi>(yea all Kings and Iudges of the earth) to kiſſe</hi> vnder paine of his anger, and heauy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 12.

Doth not the Lord ſtraightly forbid theft of man againſt man: and hath he not been angry, and is he not daily angry with them, that commit any theft againſt man? will he not then much more bee offended with theft againſt himſelfe, and againſt his ſonne Chriſt Ieſus? That which is but theft againſt man, is ſacriledge againſt God and Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>Againe, though the wicked be in neuer ſo great proſperity, yet all is moſt vncertaine; and in a moment, either all is taken from them, or they be taken from all.</p>

               <p>Touching the taking away of the wicked from their wealth and other proſperity, doth not our Sauiour teach it by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the rich man, that (like many rich men in theſe daies) was altogether carefull for enlarging his barnes, to keepe the great abundance of corne that his land had brought foorth, and to eat and drinke, and take his pleaſure for many yeeres (as thinking he had enough, and that he ſhould liue long) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thinking of any thankfulneſſe to God, neither taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny care, how to imploy, and beſtow it well to Gods glory, and the comfort of other that were in want? Doth not (I ſay) our Sauiour by this parable teach, that the wicked are oft times taken away from their wealth and other proſperity, in as much as when the ſaid rich man was occupied in thoſe former thoughts of enlarging his barnes, and taking his eaſe, &amp;c. our Sauiour telleth vs that it was preſently ſaid vnto him by the Lord, <hi>O foole this night will they fetch away thy ſoule from thee: and then whoſe ſhall all thoſe things be, which thou haſt prouided? Luk</hi> 12 20.</p>
               <p>To the ſame purpoſe <hi>Zophar</hi> ſaith, <hi>The reioicing of the wicked is ſhort: and the ioy of the hypocrite is but a moment. Though his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency mount vp to the heauens, &amp; his head reach vnto the clouds, yet he ſhall periſh for euer like his dung: and they which haue ſeene him, ſhall ſay where is he? He ſhall flie away as a dreame: and they ſhall not find him: and ſhall paſſe away as a viſion of the night. So that the eie which had ſeene him, ſhall ſee him no more: and his place ſhall ſee him no more: Iob</hi> 20. 5. <hi>Dauid</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the very ſame: <hi>I haue ſeene</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>the wicked ſtrong and ſpreading himſelfe like a Bay tree: yet he paſſed away, and loe he was gone: and I ſought him, but he could not be found: Pſal.</hi> 37. 35. 36.</p>
               <p>Doth any man require examples of theſe two points? For the firſt, let him conſider his owne experience of many daily that are left great portions, and yet liuing wickedly, come to extreme beggery. For the ſecond, that many of the wicked, hauing great ſtates are themſelues taken from all; how ſoone were <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1. <hi>Samuel</hi> 25. 38. <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 37. <hi>Saneherib,</hi> 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 37. <hi>Nebuchadnezer, Dan.</hi> 4. 28. and <hi>Herod, Acts</hi> 12. 23. how ſoone (I ſay) were all theſe taken from all their wealth,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:18428:146"/> from all their honor, from all their worldly proſperity?</p>
               <p>Touching both the former points iointly, how ſoone did <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Belſhazzer</hi> loſe both riches and honors, withall their other earthly proſperity, and life it ſelfe?</p>
               <p>Neither only is the proſperity of the wicked taken from them, or they from it, but ſometime alſo themſelues are ſo bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened therewith, that howſouer they got it with great paine, and yet perhaps alſo with ſome pleaſure, yet they are neuer well till they be disburdened of it againe. It is with them as it is with drunkards, and gluttons, who drinke largely, and eat greedily: but hauing ouer much charged their ſtomacks, they are ſicke and very ſicke till they haue vngorged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Let no man bee offended with this ſimilitude, as thinking the ſame too rude and homely for ſo diuine an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as now I am occupied in. It is the ſame that <hi>Zophar</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in the ſame caſe, and whereby he doth moſt elegantly and excellently ſet foorth the condition of the wicked in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. For thus he writeth, <hi>He hath deuoured ſubſtance, and he ſhall vomit it: for God ſhall draw it out of his belly: Iob</hi> 20. 15. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>he ſhall reſtore the labor</hi> (that is, that which he got with much labor) <hi>and ſhall deuoure no more, &amp;c.</hi> verſ. 18. and againe, <hi>Surely he ſhall feele no quietneſſe in his body</hi> (as it is with drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards and gluttons, that being more then cropfull, are alſo cropſick, and tormented in their bodies till they haue empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelues) <hi>neither ſhall he reſerue of that which hee deſired. There ſhall none of his meat be left. Therefore none ſhall hope for his goods. When he ſhall be filled with abundance, he ſhall be in pain, &amp;c.</hi> verſ. 20. 21. 22.</p>
               <p>This is ſomwhat manifeſt by the example of <hi>Achan,</hi> who (contrary to the commandement of God) <hi>hauing taken a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Babyloniſh garment, two hundred ſhekels of ſiluer, and a wedge of gold of fifty ſhekels waight</hi> (in the ſacking of <hi>Iericho)</hi> was forced himſelfe to bring all forth, and ſo he with all his family, were burnt with fire: <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 7. 20.</p>
               <p>It is more manifeſt by the example of <hi>Iudas,</hi> who hauing greedily taken thirthy pieces of ſiluer for the betraying of his Lord and Maſter, made as much haſt to be rid of it, as euer he did to get it: and he came vnſent for and brought it with
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:18428:146"/> his own hands to the Prieſts, and threw it downe, &amp;c. and then went and hanged himſelfe, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 5. 2.</p>
               <p>If the wicked do not thus with their wealth, and other proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity (for there is the ſame reaſon of all their proſperity, that there is of their wealth) yet they meet with ſuch other cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, that they were better to be in aduerſity with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, then in their proſperity, to inoy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon. For what gained <hi>Gehezi</hi> by the two ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of ſiluer, and the two changes of garments, which by lying and falſhood he got of <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian? Did not the <hi>leproſie of Naaman cleaue vnto him, and to his ſeede for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer?</hi> 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 27. Whether then had he been better to haue beene without the wealth, or without <hi>Naamans</hi> leproſie? If it were ſo with him, (that perhaps was not altogether to be accounted wicked, though in that particular he were very faulty) what is to be thought of them, that cannot be denied to be wicked?</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the wicked in gathering the bleſſings of this life together, are ſometimes the inſtruments of God for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture good of his children: that they may enioy that with eaſe, which the wicked haue ſcraped and raked together with much paine. So ſaith <hi>Salomon, The riches of the ſinner is laid vp for the iuſt: Pro.</hi> 13. 22. So alſo ſaith <hi>Iob, Though he ſhould heape vp ſiluer as the duſt, and prepare raiment as the clay; he may prepare it, but the iuſt ſhall put it on: and the innocent ſhall diuide his ſiluer: Iob</hi> 27. 16.</p>
               <p>Hereof <hi>Haman</hi> is a moſt pregnant example. For was not his houſe giuen to vertuous Queene <hi>Eſter?</hi> was not the ring which himſelfe did weare (euen when hee came with the King to the royall banquet of <hi>Eſter)</hi> giuen to godly <hi>Mordecai,</hi> whom <hi>Haman</hi> had hated with a perfect hatred? <hi>Eſter</hi> 8. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>Truely this is a great prerogatiue of the children of God, that the wicked and their enemies that ſcorned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned them, ſhould be their ſeruants to gather riches for them.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, that although the bleſſings of this life, belong only to the godly, yet ſometimes the wicked get a ſhare;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:18428:147"/> but with ſo ſmall comfort, that they were a great deale better be without it. This ſhall be ſufficient for the reaſon, both why and how the children of God hauing onely right to all the bleſſings of this life: yet ſometimes are in want, and oft times haue but a ſmall portion of them: as alſo why and how the wicked hauing no intereſt at al vnto them, yet for a time haue them in great abundance.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T remaineth now to ſhew further, why as the wicked doe thus often partake of the bleſſings of this life, promiſed, due, and proper only to the godly: ſo ſometime the godly meete alſo with afflictions threatned to the wicked, and moſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rightly belonging vnto them: and that without any impeachment of their dignity; and of the priuiledges, and prerogatiues pertaining to them.</p>
               <p>Touching this therefore, the firſt reaſon why it ſo falleth out, is like to that which before we heard of the wicked. For as the wicked ſometimes doing the outward works of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, doe therefore receiue the outward rewards of the children of God, that (as I ſaid) they may haue nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to blame the iuſtice of God (albeit, where there is any ſin, there neuer can be any merit or deſert before God) ſo the children of God, when they behaue themſelues as the wicked, doe ſomtimes taſt of the iudgements of the wicked in this life, that they may the better be freed from them, and from the feare of them in the life to come.</p>
               <p>This is manifeſt by the manifold afflictions that befell <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> after his ſinne both with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> &amp; againſt her husband
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:18428:147"/> 
                  <hi>Vrija,</hi> and alſo in numbring the people. Notwithſtanding as the Lord doth giue the wicked his bleſſings of this life, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in wrath then in fauor, (as hath been before ſaid) ſo hee doth afflict his children, not in wrath but in loue, to make them the more <hi>partaker of his holineſſe, that they may the better liue: Heb</hi> 12. 5. 6. 7. <hi>Reu.</hi> 3. 19. and to <hi>teach them his lawe; that they may haue the more reſt in the dates of euill, whiles the pit is dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the wicked: Pſal.</hi> 92. 12. Such vſe did <hi>Dauid</hi> make of his afflictions, both after the former ſinnes, and alſo at other times, as himſelfe teſtifieth ſaying, <hi>It is good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>al.</hi> 119. 71. And this kind of affliction is called <hi>the triall of our faith, much more pretious then gold that periſheth, though it be tried in the fire:</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. Becauſe as fire purgeth the gold from droſſe, and as ſope maketh the linnen cleane, ſo this affliction is a meane to purge vs of our corruption. As plowing alſo of the ground killeth the weeds, and maketh the ground the fitter to bring foorth corne: as harrowing likewiſe breaketh the hard clods, and ſo furthereth the former worke of the plough: whereby the ground ſo ploughed and harrowed may be the more fruitfull: ſo afflictions ſeem to kill the weeds of ſinne remaining in the children of God, and to mollifie the hard clods of their harts, that they may beare the more fruits of righteouſneſſe. Is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny harme to be ſo afflicted? no more then for gold to be tried in the fire: then for foule linnen to be waſhed with ſope: then for ground to be ploughed and harrowed. Therefore the man whom the Lord doth ſo correct and chaſtice is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced bleſſed: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 12. before alledged, and <hi>Iob</hi> 5. 17. Therefore alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> willeth them to whom he did write <hi>to account it exceeding ioy, when they did fall into many temptations</hi> or afflictions: <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 2. yea he maketh that the firſt precept or exhortation of all the Epiſtle, that it might be the more regarded.</p>
               <p>To ſhew more particularly how by afflictions we are taught the law of God, &amp; purged of ſuch corruptions as do ſtil remain in the beſt, let vs vnderſtand that the ſaid beſt of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, being ready by proſperity to be puffed vp, (as before we heard by the examples of <hi>Dauid, Salomon,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah)</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:18428:148"/> therefore afflictions ſerue for the represſing of ſuch pride, and to make vs the more humble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> did no ſooner heare the afflictions threatned which afterward were inflicted vpon him, but preſently he humbled himſelfe ſaying, <hi>I haue ſinned againſt the Lord:</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13. and in further teſtimonie of that his humiliation, hee did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward write the whole moſt dolefull and heauenly one and fifty Pſalme.</p>
               <p>When alſo the Angell of the Lord for his numbring the people ſmote Iſrael with the plague, how did he and the elders of Iſrael humble themſelues againe? 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17. and 1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 21. 16. as before hath been ſhewed in Chap. 18.</p>
               <p>The like hath been before ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> out of 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 26.</p>
               <p>Secondly the children of God by experiences of afflictions in themſelues are taught the more to pity other in the like affliction. Yea, this was one end of our chaſtiſement vpon Chriſt himſelfe: <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. 18.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe by much and long proſperity the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are ready to be glued to this world, too highly to regard the glory of it, and too little to reſpect the world and life to come, therefore ſometimes they are afflicted, the more to weane their hearts from the world, and by the bitter fruits thereof to make them the more weary thereof, and the more earneſtly deſirous of being <hi>diſſolued, and being with Chriſt: Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by afflictions they are taught to bee the more thankfull for the contrary blesſings, when they ſhall enioy them: as by pouerty to be the more thankfull for wealth: by ſickneſſe to be the more thankfull for health: by trouble to be the more thankfull for peace, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, by afflictions, eſpecially by thoſe that come vnto them by the hatred of the world againſt them, they haue the better aſſurance, both that themſelues are not of the world, but of God, <hi>For if they were of the world, the world would loue them: Ioh.</hi> 15. 19. and alſo of their future ſimilitude to Chriſt in glory: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. whereof we ſhall ſpeake more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. And the ſame is it that the Apoſtle teacheth the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:18428:148"/> bidding them <hi>in nothing to feare their aduerſaries.</hi> Why ſo? Becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>this is to them a token of perdition: but to you of ſaluation. Philip.</hi> 1. 28. So he ſheweth by an argument ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from compariſon of equals, that euen as to be an aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the children of God, and to perſecute them, is a token and manifeſt teſtimony, to ſuch ſo long as they continue ſuch, that they ſhall periſh: ſo to be hated of them, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by them, is a great aſſurance of ſaluation. Only this is the difference, that they that by hatred and perſecution of the children of God haue a great ſigne of perdition, may for all that, by faith working repentance, be ſaued, but they that once by any good teſtimony be aſſured of ſaluation, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer periſh.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, by ſuffering a little ſmart of the fruit of ſinne heere, they doe the better learne, both what all is that they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in the life to come, and alſo what Chriſt hath ſuffered for them, in bearing the whole puniſhment of all their ſinnes: and therefore how they ought to loue him in that behalfe, and how thankfull they ought to bee to God for their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from euerlaſting torments: in reſpect whereof, theſe light and momentany afflictions of this life, are but as fillips, and fleabites: and conſequently alſo they learne how they are to pity them that are going towards the place of ſuch tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and how in pity they are to labor their reclaiming and conuerting.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the principall particular points of the lawe of God, which the children of God doe learne by the afflictions of this life: the leaſt whereof is more worth then all outward proſperity: and all which might be much more enlarged: but finding this treatiſe to ariſe to a far greater volume then at the firſt I made account of, I am thereby forced in many things to write the more briefly. By this that I haue thus briefly ſet downe in that behalfe, it may ſufficiently appeare, that the exchange ſometimes of momentany afflictions for temporary bleſſings, is no detriment to the children of God, but rather an exceeding gaine and benefit.</p>
               <p>If it be obiected, that ſome of Gods children are ſubiect alſo to extraordinary deaths: as <hi>Eli brake his neck falling backward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Noble <hi>Ioſiah</hi> died of the wound that he had taken by the ſword of the vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Egyptians: 2. <hi>King.</hi> 23. 29. and that for going ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what obſtinately (as it ſeemeth) againſt <hi>Pharo Neco:</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 2. Many of the Corinthians are ſaid <hi>to haue ſlept</hi> (that is, to haue died ſomwhat extraordinarily, &amp; by an vntimely death) for abuſe and diſorder in the ſupper of the Lord: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 30. If (I ſay) this be obiected, and ſo confirmed by theſe former and other the like examples, and vpon thoſe grounds, it be further demanded, how ſuch things can be for the good of the children of God, and for the learning any thing out of the word of God, ſith <hi>the dead praiſe not God, neither is there any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of God in death: Pſal.</hi> 6. 5. and 30. 9. To this I anſwer briefly, that although after death there be no learning any thing (except only either of torments to the wicked, or of ioy and happineſſe to the godly, and that by ſenſe and feeling, as the rich man and <hi>Lazarus</hi> did: <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 23.) yet in ſuch ſicknes vnto death, there may be before death, and (no doubt) is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in al the children of God, of ſuch particular ſinnes, as whereby they ſee they haue procured ſuch particular chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon themſelues: and ſo by iudging of themſelues for the ſaid ſins, they haue the better aſſurance, that they ſhall not be iudged of the Lord. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith in the place before alledged, (after mention of ſickneſſe and death) <hi>when we are iudged, we are chastned of the Lord, that we ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world:</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32. which is all one with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall end of afflictions before mentioned, viz. <hi>that we may liue: Heb.</hi> 12. 9.</p>
               <p>Againe (both further to amplifie that anſwer to the former obiection, and alſo now to ſhew ſome other vſes of the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods children in reſpect of other) they are ſo afflicted (eſpecially for particular ſins) that other as well as themſelues (liuing after their ſaid vntimely death) ſeeing <hi>how he whom they call father iudgeth euerie man</hi> (as well his own children as other) <hi>according to their worke</hi> (in this world) <hi>without reſpect of perſons,</hi> may afterward <hi>paſſe the time of their dwelling here in</hi> the more <hi>feare:</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>and make an end of their ſaluation with</hi>

               <p>Secondly, in reſpect of other they are afflicted, and loaden with affliction, for the manifeſtation of their faith, patience, and other graces, to ſuch as did before doubt thereof, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that they did in the worſhip of God to be in hypocriſie; and rather becauſe God had ſo compaſſed and walled them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with his mercies, then in a ſimple, and a pure loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God himſelfe. Is not this euident by the anſwer of ſatan vnto God, when God had asked him if he <hi>had not conſidered Iob and all his vprightneſſe, &amp;c. Doth Iob</hi> (ſaith ſatan) <hi>feare God for nought? Haſt thou not made an hedge about him, and about all that he hath on euery ſide? Thou haſt bleſſed the worke of his hands, and his ſubſtance is encreaſed in the land. But ſtretch out now thine hand, and touch all that he hath, to ſee if hee will not blaſpheme thee to thy face? Iob</hi> 1. 8. 9. 10. Doth not ſatan in theſe words plainly accuſe <hi>Iob</hi> to haue done all that he had done, only in hypocriſie, &amp;c? Therefore the Lord gaue him leaue to try <hi>Iob,</hi> &amp; to exerciſe him with many afflictions one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; one in the neck of another, for the confutation of that ſlanderous accuſation of <hi>Iob</hi> by ſatan, &amp; for declaration of his integrity to al the world. Yea, (by this occaſion to inſert here another benefit by afflictions to the children of God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelues) as by wraſtling a man ſomtimes knoweth his own ſtrength better then before he did; ſo oftentimes by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, a man better knoweth his owne faith, and other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God in himſelf, for his further comfort then before he did.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in reſpect of other, ſometimes the children of God are ſo afflicted, <hi>that the workes of God may be ſhewed on them.</hi> Our Sauiour being asked by his diſciples of the man <hi>that was borne blind, whether he or his parents had ſinned, that he was borne blind,</hi> anſwered, <hi>Neither hath this man ſinned, nor his parents, but that the worke of God might be ſhewed on him: Ioh.</hi> 9. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>So it ſeemeth that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was therefore ſick, &amp; died of his ſickneſſe, (ſooner then by the courſe of nature he ſhould haue died) not for any ſpeciall ſinne of his owne, but for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manifeſtation of the glorie of God, by his miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous raiſing againe, after buriall, and after death and buriall
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:18428:150"/> diuers daies. So our Sauiour ſaith to his diſciples before hee was dead, <hi>This ſickneſſe is not vnto death</hi> (viz. to lie or continue in death till the generall reſurrection) <hi>but for the glory of God, that the ſonne of God might be glorified thereby: Ioh.</hi> 11. 4. So he ſaid after he was dead and buried, vnto <hi>Martha,</hi> who obiected, <hi>that he had been dead foure daies: Said I not vnto thee, that if thou didſt beleeue, thou ſhouldſt ſee the glory of God?</hi> verſ. 40.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the godly are ſometimes taken away by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary kind of death, not onlie to teach other the more to take heede of all ſuch ſinnes as for which they are ſo taken away: but alſo to admoniſh men not alwaies to iudge other by their end, except their life haue alſo been wicked, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hope well of them, if their former life haue been godly, albeit their end be ſomewhat vncomfortable.</p>
               <p>Finally (to make an end of my anſwer to the former obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction touching the afflictions of the children of God, ſith all afflictions are threatned only to the wicked, as all bleſſings are promiſed only to the godly) though <hi>the troubles of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous be great, yet the Lord deliuereth him out of all.</hi> Yea (though they continue long, yet) <hi>the Lord keepeth all his bones, not one of them ſhall be broken:</hi> whereas <hi>the afflictions of the wicked ſhall ſlaie them: and they that hate the righteous ſhall periſh: Pſal.</hi> 34. 19. 20. 21. Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> admoniſheth the wicked <hi>not to lay waite at the houſe of the righteous, becauſe though the iuſt man fall ſeuen times, yet he riſeth again;</hi> (that is, though he haue many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, &amp; be now vp, now preſently down, yet at the laſt the Lord deliuereth him out of all) <hi>but the wicked doe fall into miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,</hi> or do periſh, and be vtterly (at the laſt) ouerthrowne in their miſery: <hi>Pro.</hi> 24. 15. 16. Yea, <hi>though they crie, yet there ſhall be none to ſaue: yea, though they cry vnto the Lord, yet he ſhall not anſwer them. Pſal.</hi> 18. 41.</p>
               <p>Of both theſe, viz. of the deliuerance of the children of God out of their troubles, and of the periſhing of the wicked in theirs, wee haue mentioned diuers examples before, not needfull now to be repeated.</p>
               <p>Though alſo the Lord do ſuffer the afflictions of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to continue, yet in the end he will moſt gratiouſly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them by death: and tranſlate them to himſelfe, where <hi>they
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:18428:150"/> ſhall reſt from their labor:</hi> and where they ſhall reap the fruit of all <hi>their workes: Reuel.</hi> 14 13. of the which reſt and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their workes, all the afflictions of this life are not to be accounted <hi>worthy: Rom</hi> 8. 18. Yea, <hi>in reſpect of which moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and eternall weight of glorie, all affliction here is but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding light and momentany:</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. But of this more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>In the meane time the Lord will either mitigate the ſaid afflictions of his children, or ſhew his power in their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, not laying more vpon them, then he giueth ſtrength to beare, neither ſuffering them <hi>to be tempted aboue their ſtrength:</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>The Lord knoweth to deliuer the godly out of tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and to reſerue the vniuſt vnto the day of iudgment vnder puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or <hi>to be puniſhed:</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
               <p>Are not theſe things ſingular priuileges? Are they not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent dignities? To haue the right of all the bleſſings of this life? and to haue the very afflictions of this life made ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies beneficiall? ſo that the children of God may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay <hi>that light is ſowen for the righteous, and ioy for the vpright in heart: Pſal.</hi> 97. 11. but alſo that <hi>vnto the righteous ariſeth light in darkneſſe it ſelfe: Pſal.</hi> 112. 4.</p>
               <p>But is this all that may be ſaid touching the bleſſings of this life, and the afflictions thereof in reſpect of the children of God? No: we may further adde both of ſuch bleſſings, and of ſuch afflictions, and alſo of all other things, that we that are the children of God, do not vncertainly hope, but fully and moſt certainly know <hi>that all things work together for the good of them that loue God. Rom.</hi> 8. 28. What all things? yea all things: youth as well as age: weakneſſe as well as ſtrength: trouble as well as peace: ſickneſſe as well as health: pouerty as well as wealth: the ſingle ſtate as well as the married: diſgrace as well as credit: contempt as well as honor: low degree as well as high impriſonment as well as walking at large: bondage as well as freedome: loſſes as well as gaine: barrenneſſe of the body as well as fruitfulneſſe: a troubleſome wife as well as a comfortable wife: wicked and rebellious children as well as good and dutifull: death of father, mother, brother, ſiſter, husband, wife, children, and other friends, as well as the life
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:18428:151"/> and long continuance of them: trauelling abroad as well as keeping at home: baniſhment as well as abiding in our owne country: the hatred and diſpleaſure of men, euen of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men of the world, as well as their loue and friendſhip: dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as well as ſafety: foule or cold weather, as well as faire and hot weather: to conclude, death as well as life: and any one thing els, as well as another.</p>
               <p>All this is ſo to be vnderſtood, that wee may admire the wiſedome of God in turning <hi>all things to good to them that loue</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>him:</hi> and that we acknowledge the ſtate and condition of ſuch to be the more honorable and happy: not that therefore we make choice of one thing as well as of another: but that we direct our choice according to his reuealed will: and yet to be content with whatſoeuer the Lord ſhall doe, and to poſſeſſe our ſoules in patience, as knowing that howſoeuer things fall out a while, yet at the laſt the end will be good for vs.</p>
               <p>But this being a matter of good moment, it ſhall not be loſt labor to inſiſt ſomewhat more vpon it, and to make it more plaine, that all men may the better ſee, that all things worke indeed <hi>to the good of them that loue God;</hi> that is, of his children, becauſe we haue heard before, that they only do loue him, and that all the wicked are often ſaid, to be enemies and haters of him.</p>
               <p>This therefore is manifeſt; firſt, becauſe God is with al them, that loue him, as hath been before declared. <hi>If God bee with them, who can be againſt them? Rom.</hi> 8. 31. or, what skilleth it, who or what is againſt them? They may then ſay as <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 16. and as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 7. <hi>They that be with vs, are more then they that be againſt vs. God is greater then all: Ioh.</hi> 10. 29. viz. not only in power but alſo in wiſedome and goodneſſe: as before alſo hath been ſhewed. <hi>Whatſoeuer he will in heauen or in earth that he doth: Pſal.</hi> 135. 6. He will not that any thing ſhall hurt vs: therefore nothing can hurt vs. He will euery thing ſhall doe vs good; therefore euery thing ſhall doe vs good. The prouidence of the Lord is ſo ouer all, that neither a ſparrow lighteth vpon the houſe top, nor an haire falleth from our head without his ſaid prouidence: <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 29. 30. If we that are euill be ready to doe any good that is in
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:18428:151"/> our power to our children, ſhall not God much more be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to doe any good to his children? <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 11. If then God will do his children good, who can hurt? For <hi>who can reſiſt his will? His counſell ſhall ſtand, and he will do whatſoeuer he will. Iſai.</hi> 46. 10.</p>
               <p>Againe, if any thing will hurt vs, is it not to be feared from our enemies? yet our moſt deadly enemies, can God reſtraine from doing vs any hurt: yea, he can force them to do vs good? If ſatan himſelfe, euen with a great army (an whole legion of his angels) could not enter into the heard of the faithleſſe <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darens</hi> ſwine, without leaue from Chriſt; ſhall we thinke that he can doe any hurt to them (either touching their perſons, or touching their goods) that beleeuing in Chriſt are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body, without leaue from him? It is manifeſt that he cannot, by the hiſtory of <hi>Iob:</hi> yea, by that hiſtory it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that albeit ſatans malice be vnchangeable, ſo that he cannot but in affection bee an enemy to all the children of God; yet by the wiſe and gratious prouidence of God, he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the good of Gods children, and in that reſpect his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice may be ſaid to be turned into friendſhip. For was not <hi>Iob</hi> ſo much the more bleſſed in the end (euen in his outward ſtate) by how much the more ſatan had (as it were) curſed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? The like may be truly ſaid of all other enemies of fleſh. For all ſuch enemies are but ſatans ſouldiers: which doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by his appointment: and therefore that which they are by Gods prouidence forced to do for Gods children, may be ſaid to be done by ſatan himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The ſame is alſo manifeſt by the curſes of ſatans eldeſt ſon, againſt vs here in England. For as all the while we had the Popes bleſſing we fared the worſe in ſoule and in body, for this life and for the life to come; ſo haue we not ſeen by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the more he hath curſed vs, the more God hath bleſſed vs with peace, with honour in the eies of all nations, with increaſe of people, and abundance of all bleſſings? Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſuch enemies therefore of fleſh, God can either make them friends to his children: <hi>Pro.</hi> 16. 7. (yea, though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill vaſſals vnto ſatan) as he did <hi>Eſau</hi> vnto <hi>Iaakob,</hi> and the Egyptians to the Iſraelites for the lending vnto them their
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:18428:152"/> iewels, &amp;c. or he can confound them, as he did the Egyptians afterward, returning againe to their former hatred againſt the Iſraelites. And as he did <hi>Sanaherib</hi> and his army, or he can ſo reſtrain them, that though their hatred with all the practiſes therof do continue, yet all ſhall be in vaine, touching any hurt to the children of God, and in the end for their good.</p>
               <p>The more maliciouſly that the Egyptians purſued the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites being departed out of Egypt, the more glorious deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance did the Lord giue to the Iſraelites. The perſecution of <hi>Dauid</hi> by <hi>Saul</hi> made the more to <hi>Dauids</hi> aduancement. All that ſatan did by <hi>Haman</hi> againſt <hi>Mordecai</hi> and the reſt of the Iewes, wrought together for the further good of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai,</hi> and the other Iewes. For thereby they had a greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and a greater hand againſt all their enemies, then euer before they had.</p>
               <p>Yea, when ſatan alſo getteth ſome of the children of God to be his inſtruments, and factors (as it were) to worke ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe againſt ſome of the better children of God, God doth no more fauor this proceeding, then if it were altogether by ſatan himſelfe, &amp; by ſuch as do belong vnto him: yea, though ſuch things be begun by ſome of the children of God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and afterward ſeconded by ſome other altogether wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, yet this ſhal not procure the hurt of thoſe better children of God, but rather the further good both of them, and alſo of thoſe whom ſatan draweth to practiſe miſchiefe againſt them whom he eſpecially hateth. Is not al this manifeſt by the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Ioſeph?</hi> For did not ſatan firſt prouoke <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him? euen to ſell him out of the country to certaine Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maelite merchants? Did not theſe ſecond the former practiſe of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren by ſelling him further off, namely to <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar</hi> in Egypt? Was not all that ſeconded againe by <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife; firſt moſt wickedly tempting <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to adultery? and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly (when that way ſhe could do nothing) by falſe accuſing him to her husband of a rape offered by him vnto her? was not that alſo ſeconded by the vniuſt dealing of <hi>Potiphar,</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to the kings priſon, without any examination of the complaint of his wife? When <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had lien long there, and at laſt interpreted the dreames of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> butler &amp; baker,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:18428:152"/> might not all the former hard dealing againſt him ſeem to be yet furthered by the butlers long forgetfulneſſe of him? yet al theſe things wrought together at the laſt, both for the great aduancement of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> according to his former dreames (the cauſe of all the former hatred of his brethren againſt him) and alſo for the good of his brethren themſelues, and of all their houſes. So we ſee that God <hi>that fetcheth light out of darknes,</hi> can make the ſins of his children ſomtime to worke for their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good: not to incourage any to ſinne, but to comfort all belonging vnto him, againſt too much feare of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments deſerued by ſinne, and to ſhew the exceeding priuilege of his children in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the working together of the practiſes of ſatan &amp; of his inſtruments for the good of the children of God: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſaid children of God may the better aſſure themſelues, that much more wil other creatures worke for their good.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not need to ſpeak any thing in this behalfe of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heauen. For no man will make any queſtion of their working together for the good of Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: euen for their good in this life, and of this life (which is the point now prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in hand) ſith they pitch their tents round about them to preſerue them from dangers, &amp; do otherwiſe attend vpon them for their good, both aliue and dead: as afterward we ſhall heare.</p>

Is not euery creature to God as the pot to the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 21.</p>
               <p>This that hath been ſpoken of <hi>the working together of all things to the good of them that loue God,</hi> is the greater priuiledge for ſuch as do ſo loue God, and who by ſuch loue doe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhew themſelues to be the children of God, becauſe it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth on the contrary, that all things worke together to the hurt of them that doe not loue God: and ſo do ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues not to be the children of God. This point is ſo plaine by the contrary point before largely handled, that it ſhall not need any further confirmation. Thus much for the benefits concerning this preſent life, belonging to the children of God.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the benefits of the children of God in the life to come, and firſt of their freedome from condemnation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto we haue heard of the benefits of the children of God in this life, both for this life, and alſo for the life to come. Now it followeth to ſpeake of thoſe which they ſhall enioy in the life to come. Theſe are two. Firſt that they are freed from euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting condemnation: ſecondly, <hi>that they are heires yea heires annexed with Chriſt.</hi> Both theſe follow vpon thoſe things before ſpoken, concerning the dignity of Gods children. And firſt concerning the former, it followeth
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:18428:154"/> vpon that which hath been ſaid of Gods loue in making vs his children. For how doth it ſtand with any reaſon or iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that ſuch as God loueth, and hath made his children ſhall be condemned? Againe, if by faith we are ſaued (as hath been ſhewed) how can we be condemned? The like may be ſaid hereof, in reſpect of our incorporation into Chriſt. For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus: Rom</hi> 8. 1. ſo alſo in reſpect of other points of that matter wherein we ſhewed the being of the children of God to conſiſt; therefore in the former place, they that are in Chriſt Ieſus are deſcribed immediatly in this manner, according to thoſe things before ſpoken of the matter (as it were) of Gods children, viz <hi>that they walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> So <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, of them <hi>that loue the brethren</hi> (one principall point of the ſaid matter of the children of God) <hi>Hereby we know that we are tranſlated from death to life, if we loue the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
               <p>The ſame is alſo manifeſt, by the ende of Chriſts comming before ſpoken of. For therefore did he come into the world, that <hi>whoſoeuer doth belieue in him ſhould not periſh, &amp;c. Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. and <hi>that he might deliuer all them which for feare of death, were all their life time ſubiect to bondage: Heb.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
               <p>This alſo followeth from the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes before likewiſe handled. For ſinnes being that whereby we deſerue condemnation, it muſt needs follow, that they being taken away, condemnation is alſo taken away. Being diſcharged of the offence, wee cannot but be releaſed of the puniſhment. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? It is God that iuſtifieth, who ſhall condemne? It is Christ which is dead, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 8. 33. 34. So theſe three are ioined together: No man to accuſe where God iuſtifieth: no condemnation to them for whom Chriſt died: The Papiſts indeed doe boldly affirme, that the fault remitted, the puniſhment is often retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But as this is contrary to the former, and to diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcriptures, ſo in common reaſon it is fooliſh, abſurd, and groſſe. For what a thing is this to ſay, that a man hath his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon pardoned, but yet he ſhall be hanged, drawn and quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? Were not a man as good haue no pardon of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:18428:155"/> as haue ſuch a pardon? If the Papiſts haue no better par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of their ſinnes (as indeed they ſhall not, without great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and renouncing of their damnable errours) they ſhall be in a wofull caſe. Touching the truth of this point, that the children of God are freed from condemnation, I ſhall not need to ſay any more.</p>
               <p>Neither ſhall I need largely to prooue, that this freedome from condemnation is onely proper to the children of God: ſith they onely are elect to ſaluation, they onely are beloued of God, they only beleeue in Chriſt, and by faith are made his members, they onely may ſay, they haue not <hi>receiued the ſpirit of bondage to feare,</hi> they onely walke according to the ſpirit, they onely haue forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The chiefe thing that I doe here propound to my ſelfe to ſhewe is, how great a benefit and priuiledge this is. That wee may therefore ſee this, let vs conſider a little (as wee may) what condemnation is.</p>
               <p>Briefly, and in one word, Condemnation is the whole curſe of God in the world to come, firſt vpon the ſoule onely, till the day of iudgement, then vpon ſoule and body after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, for euer and euer.</p>
               <p>But let vs yet ſee the degrees of it more particularly.</p>
               <p>The firſt degree therefore is, the angry, wrathfull, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenance, rebuke &amp; ſentence of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the Iudge of all the world, againſt them, that are before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>or ordained to condemnation:</hi> viz. <hi>againſt all the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which before had turned the grace of God into wantonneſſe, and denied God the onely Lord, and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, Iude</hi> 4. <hi>when they ſhall be all gathered before him.</hi> For then ſhall the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that great Iudge of all the world, ſpeake vnto ſuch in this manner; <hi>Depart from mee ye curſed into euerlaſting fire prepared for the deuill and his angels, Matthew</hi> 25. 32. and 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The wrath of a King</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon) is like the roaring of a lyon, he that prouoketh him to anger ſinneth againſt his owne ſoule, Pro.</hi> 19. 12. and 20. 2. Is the wrath of a mortall king (whoſe breath is in his noſtrels) ſo fearefull? How fearefull (alas) then is the wrath of the immortall King of Kings, <hi>that ſetteth vp and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:18428:155"/> caſteth down?</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 8. and <hi>by whom all Kings reigne, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces decree iuſtice? &amp;c. Pro.</hi> 8. 15.</p>
               <p>The rebuke of a King is the more heauy, the more publike it is. How heauy then ſhall that rebuke of the King of kings be, which ſhall be giuen in the preſence of all the world; not only before all men, but alſo before all the Angels, both good and bad?</p>
               <p>The ſecond degree of condemnation is in the former ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, viz. the ſeparation from the gratious and comfortable preſence of God: For our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>depart from me ye cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp;c.</hi> When he ſaith <hi>depart from me,</hi> he meaneth the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, not only from himſelf the ſecond perſon in the Deity, but alſo from the <hi>father</hi> and <hi>holy ghost.</hi> For as they that haue communion with Chriſt haue alſo communion with the <hi>Father and the holy ghoſt</hi> (as before hath been ſhewed:) ſo they that are depriued of Chriſts company, are likewiſe depriued of the company <hi>of the Father, and of the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be without God in this world (as we haue heard before) is one principal point of our miſery by nature before our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Yet there they that are ſo without God, haue often times many friends &amp; great friends, which for a while ſeem much to allay their miſery, &amp; as it were to ſtill them like little children, in their abſence from God. If it be ſuch a thing to be heere without God, where we haue many other friends with whom a little to while away the time, what alaſſe (will it be to be without God in the world to come, where we ſhall haue no friends at all with whom to paſſe away the time, or by whom to haue any comfort?</p>
               <p>Amongſt men, when ſubiects begin to be ſuſpected of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or otherwiſe to be in diſgrace with their ſoueraigns, this is no ſmall degree to further puniſhment afterward, viz. to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from the court of ſuch princes, or to be commanded to keep out of their preſence. After that <hi>Abſalom</hi> for the murder of his brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> had fled from <hi>Dauid</hi> (as fearing his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure) &amp; had bin abſent (as a baniſhed ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) for three yeers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, &amp; yet after that, was ſo reconciled to his father, that he might returne into the kingdome, but notwithſtanding was commanded <hi>to goe to his owne houſe and not to ſee the kings face:</hi>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:18428:156"/> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 24. in which ſtate he continued for two yeers more; how did <hi>Abſalom</hi> take this? Truly, as bad as he was, yet he took it ſo heauily, that he neglected no meanes (vſuall with carnall men) for the recouering againe of the Kings fauour, that he might ſee the Kings face as he had done. And therefore when he had ſent diuers times for <hi>Ioab,</hi> to intreat him to be a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator for him to the King his father in that behalfe (as he had before for bringing him againe into the kingdome) and that yet <hi>Ioab</hi> would not come at him, then he cauſed his men to ſet <hi>Ioabs</hi> corne on fire: vpon which occaſion <hi>Ioab</hi> came to him, and then <hi>Abſalom</hi> vſed him for recouery of <hi>Dauids</hi> fauor, that he might ſee his face: verſ. 29. Doth not all this argue, that <hi>Abſalom</hi> (though a wicked man) tooke it as a great puniſhment ſo to be baniſhed from his Princes court, and from his fathers houſe? Yea, it is a great puniſhment for any child to be bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from his Fathers houſe, though his father be far inferior to a Prince. Was it not much for <hi>Hagar</hi> with her ſonne <hi>Iſhmael</hi> to be thrown out of the houſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to be ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wide world, they could not tell whither: to ſhift for themſelues, they knew not where nor how? <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 21. 14. How great a thing this was, their miſery afterward doth declare. For as the prodigall ſonne ſaid, <hi>How many hired ſeruants at my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, haue bread enough, and I die for hunger? Luk</hi> 15. 17. (to note, that in the houſe and preſence of God, there is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough for the meaneſt perſon therein; but out of the <note place="margin">Note.</note> houſe of God, there is all want and extreme miſery) ſo where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> had ſufficient of all things in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe (which then was the houſe and Church of God) being caſt out of the ſame, they were in a ſhort time ready to dy for want of water: <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 15.</p>
               <p>If then it be ſo great a matter for a ſubiect to be baniſhed from his Prince-Court and preſence; and for a child to be thruſt out of his earthly fathers houſe, to ſee his face no more: oh how great a thing is it, to be excluded from the Court of God, and from the moſt comfortable light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in heauen! It is an heauy thing, to be baniſhed from the houſe and preſence of God, as he reuealeth himſelfe in his word, vpon the earth. Before the law it was the greateſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:18428:156"/> (almoſt) that could be in this world: <hi>Gen</hi> 3. 23. and 4. 14. and 17. 14. and euen vpon the giuing of the law: <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 15. 19. and after the giuing of the law: <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 33. and 38. as alſo in the time of the Goſpell: 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 14. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim</hi> 1. 20. In which two laſt places, the heauineſſe of this thing (I meane to be ſhut out from or throwen out of the houſe and preſence of God here vpon the earth) is much aggrauated by this phraſe, of deliuering ouer, or giuing vp to ſatan: For doe we not therby plainly ſee, that they that are ſo cut off from the houſe, and ſhut out of the preſence of God, are immediatly in the hands of ſatan himſelfe, and ſo doe continue whiles they continue in that ſeparation from God and from his houſe?</p>
               <p>For this cauſe, <hi>Dauid</hi> by the tyranny of <hi>Saul</hi> and by the malice of his other enemies, being baniſhed out of the land, and forced to be abſent from the tabernacle of God, took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo grieuouſly as that. He neuer lamenteth his abſence from his country, from his friends, from his other commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which before he had enioied at home: but oft times doth he moſt heauily bewaile the other. It is the whole argument of the 84. Pſalme: wherein he lamenteth his miſery in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, by conſideration of the beauty of Gods tabernacles; by laying forth his vehement deſire thereunto: by preferring the condition of the ſparrowes and ſwallowes before his owne: (becauſe they might ſing and build their neſts neerer to Gods altar, then he could come) and by laying forth the happineſſe of them, that had daily acceſſe thereunto, though it were with much labor, much charge, and much wearineſſe. So it is a good part of the 143. Pſalme, where he profeſſeth that <hi>his ſoule did as much thirſt after the Lord</hi> (meaning his preſence by his word and Sacraments, and other meanes in his tabernacle) <hi>as thirſty lands</hi> did in ſummer gape (as it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e) for ſhowres of rain: verſ 6.</p>
               <p>In the two and fortie Pſalme he vſeth he ſame metaphor of <hi>thirſting,</hi> but with compariſon of himſelfe therein, vnto the Harrs deſire of water, being chaſed with hounds in ſummer: verſe 1. &amp;c. yea, he profeſſeth in the next verſe, that in regard of the reproches of the wicked which vpbraided him with his
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:18428:157"/> baniſhment from the tabernacle, as though he had truſted in God in vain, and therfore in ſcornefull manner had ſaid vnto him, <hi>where is thy God?</hi> (as the Iewes did the like to Chriſt: <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 43) he profeſſeth (I ſay) that in regard of theſe reproches his heart was ſo filled with ſorrow, that <hi>his teares had been his meat day and night;</hi> yea ſo abundant and vehement was his grief in that behalfe, that he found his ſoule euen to melt and (as it were) to ſwoone within him: in which reſpect he was faine to comfort the ſame (as it were) with <hi>aqua compoſita,</hi> and to ſay therunto twice in that Pſalme: <hi>Why art thou caſt down my ſoule? why art thou ſo diſquieted within me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it ſo heauy a matter, to be ſeparated here from Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in his houſe and Church vpon the earth? How heauy then will it be, to be ſeparated from his preſence and dwelling place in the heauens, and from all communion with the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Church <hi>in the heauenly places?</hi> Did <hi>Dauid</hi> find ſuch ſorrow, ſuch griefe, ſuch wo, and ſuch pangs in his ſoule by his abſence from Gods earthly tabernacle? Alas then, what ſhal be the woe, the gripes of griefe, and the howling of thoſe, that ſhal be or are already ſeparated from heauen it ſelfe in the world to come? Thus much for the ſecond degree of condemnation, wherby the better appeareth how great the priuilege of Gods children is, in their freedome and diſcharge from the ſame.</p>
               <p>The third degree of condemnation is, that the wicked are not baniſhed only from the comfortable preſence of God, but alſo from al other good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany; yea, from euery thing that is good.</p>
               <p>A ſubiect that is baniſhed from the court, and preſence of his Prince, and a ſon that is baniſhed from the houſe and preſence of his louing Father, may notwithſtanding haue ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, either at home in his own houſe, or in any other place whither he is baniſhed, or within which he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fined: either by ſome other good company; or by the vſe of ſome other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities; for the better vpholding &amp; ſupporting of himſelfe. But if beſides baniſhment from his Princes Court and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or from his fathers houſe and countenance, a man be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo depriued of all other good company, and of all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, how wofull is his ſtate and condition? What then is to be ſaid of the condemnation of the wicked in this behalfe? in
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:18428:157"/> that (I ſay) they ſhall not only be caſt out from the preſence of God, but alſo be bereaued of alother good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany &amp; comfort.</p>
               <p>The fourth degree of condemnation is, that beſides the three former, they ſhall be awarded the company of the diuell, and his Angels. So our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into euerlaſting fire, prepared for the diuell and his angels.</hi> In this deſcription of euerlaſting fire from the perſons to whom the ſame belongeth, or for whom it is prepared, and who alſo were firſt thrown into it, (namely the diuell and his angels) we ſee who ſhall be the companions of thoſe that ſhall be thrown out from the preſence of God.</p>
               <p>How fearfull this is, let it be conſidered, by the fearfulneſſe that is in the beſt and ſtouteſt hearted men, at the apparition euen of bleſſed ſpirits. For to omit how <hi>Mary</hi> feared when the Angell appeared vnto her with the ioyfulleſt ſalutation that euer before ſhe had heard: To omit (I ſay) her feare, becauſe ſhe was but a woman: To omit alſo the feare of the ſhepheards when <hi>the Angell of the Lord came vpon them, &amp;c. and brought them glad tidings that ſhould be to all people, viz. that vnto them was that day borne a Sauiour, &amp;c. Luk.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To omit (I ſay) this alſo, becauſe they being but ſimple, poore, and plaine men might (perhaps) be afraid without a cauſe (and yet who oftentimes of better courage then ſuch?) How did <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> a valiant man, a man of courage, <hi>a Captaine of a band called the Italian band, a deuout man alſo</hi> (or a religious man) <hi>and one that feared God,</hi> how did he feare, when an Angell came to him, as he was priuately humbled before God in praier and faſting (oh how few ſuch, or other great perſons in theſe daies are ſo exerciſed in their priuat cloſets!) and when the ſaid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell called him by his name, <hi>Cornelius? Acts</hi> 10. 3. 4.</p>
               <p>Neither onely is the apparition of ſpirits indeed thus fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to fleſh and bloud, euen to the ſtoueſt: but alſo the very ſuſpition and imagination of a ſpirit is very fearfull: not to one alone, but to many together.</p>
               <p>When all the diſciples ſaw our Sauiour <hi>come walking vpon the ſea, in the night toward their ſhip, how were they troubled; how cried they out for feare, ſaying</hi> (according to their imagination) <hi>It is a ſpirit? Mat.</hi> 14. 26. After that alſo, how <hi>were</hi> the ſaid <hi>diſciples
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:18428:158"/> abaſhed and afraid</hi> (when in the meane time by the companie and ſermons, and works of our Sauiour they ſhould haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered more ſtrength) <hi>ſuppoſing only they had ſeen a ſpirit. Luk.</hi> 24. 37. becauſe Chriſt came vnto them, <hi>and stood in the midſt of them, all the dores of the houſe</hi> (where they were) <hi>being faſt ſhut?</hi> Was the apparition of a bleſſed ſpirit from heauen, ſent with moſt comfortable meſſage ſo fearfull to them before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned? Was the bare ſuppoſition and imagination of a ſpirit, ſo fearefull to all the diſciples, not once but twice? Alaſſe then, how fearefull ſhall it be to the wicked in the end to haue the company of no other, but of all vncleane ſpirits, euen of all the diuels in hell!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> crieth out, as bewailing his condition, that in the time of his exile he was not only baniſhed from the Courts of God, and from the tabernacles of God, and from thoſe ioifull aſſemblies that ſometimes he had had in thoſe places, but was alſo forced to dwell for a time with the wicked: <hi>Woe is to mee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I remaine in Meſhech and dwell in the tents of Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> My ſoule hath too long dwell with him that hateth peace: Pſal.</hi> 120. 5. 6. Indeed the companie of the wicked here is the porch or portall of hell: and the wicked are called diuels, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 70. yet they are but yoong diuels and little diuels, in reſpect of the diuels in hell, and ſome of them are ſometimes by the mercie of God made Saints. If therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> thought it ſo wofull, and if it be indeed ſo wofull to be but in the porch or portall of hell, and to dwell but a little, and as it were to lodge a night or two by the way in our pilgrimage heere, and our iourney towards heauen, in an Inne with yoong and little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels; how wofull may the wicked thinke it will be to dwell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies withall the great and maſter diuels in hell it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Truly how lightly ſoeuer they account it now, becauſe they do but ſlightly think of it, yet one ſerious thought of it would make their haire ſtand vpright on their heads. If it doe not, the leſſe feare they finde by hearing and thinking of it heere, the more ſhall their feare be when they ſhall ſee this foule company, and none but them.</p>
               <p>The fifth degree of condemnation is, that beſides all hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſaid of this argument, they ſhalbe throwen into a place
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:18428:158"/> of vtter darkneſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 12. and 22. 13. and 25. 30. And indeed how can it be otherwiſe? For ſith <hi>God is light, and in him dwelleth no darkneſſe, 1. Ioh.</hi> 1. 5. and ſeeing <hi>he dwelleth in the light that none can attaine vnto, 1. Tim.</hi> 6. 16. and ſeeing Chriſt Ieſus alſo is <hi>the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, and the light of the world,</hi> (as before we haue heard) therefore it cannot be, but that ſuch as are ſhut out from the preſence of God, and of Chriſt, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in extreme darkneſſe. As alſo the wicked doe heere <hi>loue darkneſſe more then light, Ioh.</hi> 3. 19. ſo it is meet they ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward be committed to a place of darkneſſe. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo when the wicked are heere conuerted, they are ſaid to be <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from darkneſſe to light, Act.</hi> 26. 18. and to <hi>bee called out of darkneſſe into his maruellous light, 1. Pet.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
               <p>How fearefull in this behalfe the condemnation of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhall be, may appeare if we ſhall conſider both that which I haue before written in Chap. 10. of the ſpirituall darknes and blindneſſe of the wicked in this world, as alſo that which wee daily ſee of outward darknes heere, and of the vncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition of ſuch as are either blinde, and ſo liue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in darkneſſe, or that are caſt into priſons and dungeons, where they are depriued of all light.</p>
               <p>The ſixth degree of condemnation is, that beſides all the former points, the wicked ſhall haue moſt exquiſite, yea vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable torments, yea ſuch as no heart of man can conceiue. Theſe are expreſſed by the names of ſuch things in this world as are to fleſh and blood moſt fearefull.</p>
               <p>For in thoſe places before alleged, <hi>Matth</hi> 8. 12. and 22. 13. and 25. 30. the place of condemnation is not onely called <hi>a place of vtter darkneſſe,</hi> but a place alſo <hi>where is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is alſo called by the name of death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. yea alſo of the ſecond death, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2. 11. And this ſecond death is tenne thouſand times worſe then the firſt death, I meane then the ſeparation only of the ſoule and the body: yea it were better ten thouſand times that the ſoule and the body of the wicked ſhould die and vtterly periſh and come to nothing, (as the life and body of beaſts doe) then that they ſhould bee tormented as they ſhall be.</p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:18428:159"/>
               <p>Therfore it is called by the name both of the ſecond death, and alſo of fire, euen of <hi>the lake that burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone: Reu.</hi> 19. 20. and 20. 10.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe called <hi>a worme and a fire, Marc.</hi> 9. 44. &amp;c. where in verſe 43. the word <hi>hell and ſire</hi> are ioined together.</p>
               <p>How intolerable alſo the paines and torment of hell bee, it appeareth by that of the rich mans ſoule <hi>in hell, Luk.</hi> 16. 23. 24. where it is ſaid, that he being (touching his ſoule) <hi>in hell, and ſeeing Lazarus a farre off in Abrahams boſome</hi> (marke this word <hi>afarre off,</hi> againſt the Papiſts, that will haue <hi>Abrahams boſome</hi> to be neere vnto hell, and a part of hell it ſelfe) <hi>he cried out to Abraham, that Lazarus</hi> (to whom before he had denied all comfort, and to whom his dogs had ſhewed more mercy then himſelfe) he cried (I ſay) that <hi>Lazarus might be ſent to dip the top of his finger in water for the cooling of his tongue.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I am tormented in this flame.</hi> Such then were his paines and torments, that if he might haue had but a little eaſe for one member, he would haue accounted it an exceeding fauour. Such alſo ſhall be the torments of all other the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that ſhall be condemned. And although the torments of condemnation be thus deſcribed by theſe fearfull things in this life: yet the truth is, that no fearefull thing in this world, can ſufficiently expreſſe the torments of the wicked in the world to come. The moſt exquiſite torments that euer haue been deuiſed by any mercileſſe, cruell, and ſauage tyrants for the bodies of men, hanging, burning, either all at once or by piece-meales, renting in pieces with wild horſes, pinching the fleſh off with hot irons, boyling in lead, ſawing, broiling vpon gridyrons, and ſuch like, all theſe (I ſay) are but ſports, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes, delights and pleaſures, in reſpect of the torments to come in an other world.</p>
               <p>All theſe degrees of condemnation hitherto ſpoken of, are the more, becauſe the ſaid condemnation ſo deſcribed ſhall be euerlaſting, without end, without any mitigation: that is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified <hi>by the worme that dieth not, and by the fire that neuer goeth out: Mark.</hi> 9. 44. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo by the anſwer before ſpoken of, of <hi>Abraham</hi> to the rich man tormented in hell: therefore alſo we heard it before called <hi>euerlaſting fire, and euerlaſting paine:
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:18428:159"/> Mat.</hi> 25. 46. and <hi>euerlaſting perdition,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>Yea, ſo farre is the condemnation of the wicked from all end and mitigation, that when all other things ſhall haue a kind of end, and when the ſoules of the wicked ſhall be ioyned to their bodies in the day of iudgment, then likewiſe ſhal their torments be increaſed.</p>
               <p>This much amplifieth all the former. It is much to haue the frowning countenance, and wrathfull ſentence of God: to be baniſhed from his gratious preſence, and to be depriued of all good company, and of all other good things: to bee made a companion of diuels: and to be caſt into the place of <hi>vtter darkeneſſe, where is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> and there to be tormented with a worme gnawing, and a fire burning: all theſe things (I ſay) are very much, though they ſhould be but for a time: but neuer to haue God to looke cheerefully vpon them, or to ſpeake comfortably vnto them: to bee baniſhed from his gratious preſence for euer: neuer to haue any good company, nor any other comfortable thing: to be alwayes companion with the diuels, and to be throwne into the place of darkeneſſe, from whence there is no hope of any redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and to be tormented vnſpeakably for euer, without any mitigation: to haue a worme alwaies gnawing within, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dying, and a fire euer burning without, and neuer conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming or waſting: alas, alas, what eare doth not tingle to heare, what heart doth not quake and ake, tremble and ſhiuer to thinke vpon it? Yea, who quaketh not, who in euery member and ioynt trembleth not to conſider of it, though himſelfe be aſſured of freedome and diſcharge from it? How then ſhall they quake, quiuer, and tremble, that ſhall indeed bee ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned? All miſerie and puniſhments here are ſomewhat mitigated to him that ſuffereth them, by hope of an end at the laſt, if not before, yet at leaſt, in the houre of death.</p>
               <p>The hardeſt apprentiſhip that euer was, with the moſt cruel &amp; merciles maſter, after the longeſt time ſerued had ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by thinking the time thereof to come, to bee ſhorter than that that was paſt. The like may beſaid of any other bondage: But in the condemnation of the wicked, the longeſt time is alwaies behind. A beginning there is, but no ending. An hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:18428:160"/> yeers paſt a thouſand follow: and ſo million after milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. O dolefull, ô wofull, ô fearfull condition!</p>
               <p>When <hi>Saul</hi> heard of the loſſe of this life the day following, not by the ſpirit of truth, but by the father of lies ſatan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not transformed into an Angell of light, but only appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the habit of a Prophet, <hi>He fell ſtraightway all along vpon the earth, and was ſore afraid becauſe of thoſe words, ſo that there was no ſtrength in him,</hi> neither could any body (almoſt) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him: 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 17. <hi>Belſhazzars countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him</hi> (at the ſight of the hand writing vpon the wall, writing indeed his preſent ouerthrow, yet not to his vnderſtanding, till <hi>Daniel</hi> did read and interpret the ſaid writing) <hi>that the ioints of his loines were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt the other: Dan.</hi> 5. 6. His bones (as we ſay) did rattle in his skin, becauſe from the guiltineſſe of his conſcience, he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the worſt, though as yet hee knew nothing. How then (think we) was he perplexed when the ſentence of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained, was executed vpon him? <hi>Felix trembled to heare Paul but diſpute</hi> (or preach) <hi>of righteouſneſſe, temperance, and the iudgement to come: Acts</hi> 24 25. Alas then, how do al thoſe trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and gnaſh their teeth, that do already feele the execution of the ſentence of condemnation in their ſoules? And how ſhall they, and all other the wicked, quake and tremble in the day of iudgement, when they ſhall receiue the full ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation againſt their ſoules and bodies for euer and euer, without reuocation, without mitigation?</p>
               <p>The more fearfull that thus it appeareth and is manifeſt ſhal bee the condemnation of the wicked that die in their ſinnes; the greater priuiledge, prerogatiue and dignity it ſhall be to the children of God to be freed and diſcharged from the ſame. I might haue illuſtrated all before ſpoken of condemnation, eſpecially of the extreme puniſhment of the wicked, with the perpetuity thereof, by the extremity of diuers bodily paines here in this life; euen in ſome one member, and but for a time: as of extreme tooth-ache: of the ſtrangullion: of the ſtone in the bladder, or in the kidneys: of the gout; of the collick: and ſuch like. For if theſe things but in one part of the body, and but for a time be ſo intollerable, what (alas) ſhall we thinke of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:18428:160"/> the euerlaſting torments of euery member of the body and ſoule, and the whole man for euer and euer? But it ſhall be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, thus only to haue pointed at theſe things. Thus much for the firſt benefit of the children of God in the life to come, viz. for their freedome from condemnation.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſecond benefit of the children of God in the life to come, is, that they ſhall be all heires, and haue a great inheritance. So ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>If we be children, wee are alſo heires; euen heires of God, and heires an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed with Chriſt: Rom.</hi> 8. 17. and againe, <hi>If thou be a ſonne, thou art alſo an heire of God through Chriſt: Galat.</hi> 4. 7. So <hi>Peter</hi> ioineth together the worke of our regeneration, and the hope of an inheritance: 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>Touching this inheritance, as before we noted certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of that condemnation from which wee heard the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God to be freed, the better to ſet forth their dignity in that their deliuerance; ſo let vs now alſo obſerue certaine cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances pertaining to this inheritance; for the better illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the dignity of the children of God, in reſpect of the ſaid inheritance.</p>
               <p>Although therefore we did not before note the placing of the reprobate at the left hand of Chriſt, as any degree of their condemnation, becauſe it is not alwaies a diſhonor to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the left hand of Princes (in which reſpect <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> deſired to be placed the one at the right hand, the other at the left hand of Chriſt) yet to be placed at the right hand of Chriſt Ieſus, when he ſhall come to iudge the quick and the dead, may well be accounted for a principall honor of them that ſhall be ſo placed.</p>
               <p>So great an honor is it to be placed at the right hand of mortal Princes, that by a metaphor taken from the ſame, the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:18428:161"/> and glorification of Chriſt Ieſus is often deſcribed and expreſſed by <hi>ſitting at the right hand of his Father.</hi> Is it not then a great honour for all the elect, at the day of iudgement to be placed at the right hand of Ieſus Chriſt, when hee ſhall come in the glory of his Father, with the holy Angels?</p>
               <p>The ſecond circumſtance of the inheritance of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is contrary to the firſt degree before mentioned, of the condemnation of the wicked: <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt Ieſus ſhall grace them with a moſt amiable countenance, and moſt gratiouſly ſpeake vnto them; <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, &amp;c. The fauour of a King is like the dewe vpon the graſſe, Prou.</hi> 19. 12. How great then is the fauour of God? <hi>Dauid</hi> oppoſeth the light of Gods countenance to all worldly proſperitie deſired by the greateſt ſort of men, and profeſſeth that he had, or ſhould haue more ioy of heart thereby, than the men of the world haue in the day of their <hi>harueſt, and when their corne and wine doe encreaſe, Pſal.</hi> 4. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Both theſe circumſtances are the more, becauſe Chriſt himſelfe ſhall ſo place them at his right hand, and ſo ſpeake vnto them publikely, in the preſence of his Father, and before all men, and angels good and bad; euen before all their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. The more publikely, and in the greater company that the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> did grace his old benefactor <hi>Francis Freſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobald,</hi> the Italian merchant, firſt in the open ſtreet in <hi>London,</hi> diſmounting from his horſe, embracing him moſt familiarly, ſpeaking moſt kindly vnto him, and inuiting him the ſame day to dinner, before all the Lords, and other attendants vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: and afterward, at his comming to dine with him, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him againe, and ſpeaking alſo moſt kindly as before, and declaring to the Lord Admirall and other nobles with him, what the ſaid <hi>Freſcobald</hi> had done for him, and at dinner placing him next to himſelfe: The more publikely (I ſay) and before the more company that the ſaid Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> did ſo grace that poore decaied merchant, the greater honour it was to the ſaid merchant to be ſo graced. How great then ſhall the honour of all Gods children bee, to be placed at the right hand of Ieſus Chriſt, and to bee ſo gratiouſly ſpoken vnto by Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, in the preſence of all the world, before
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:18428:161"/> all kings and princes, as well as before all other the meaner ſort of men: as likewiſe before his owne Father: before all his holy angels: and before the diuels themſelues, the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of hell?</p>
               <p>The third circumſtance concerning the inheritance of the children of God, is, that they ſhall haue a more neere commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and with Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, than euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had: <hi>viz.</hi> not only ſpirituall, but alſo locall, beeing there where himſelfe is in all glory and maieſtie. This is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the words of our Sauiour before alleadged, <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my father, &amp;c.</hi> The ſame is likewiſe plaine by the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our Sauiour for all Gods children, <hi>Father I will that they which thou haſt giuen me, bee with mee, euen where I am, that they may behold my glory, &amp;c. Ioh.</hi> 17. 24.</p>
               <p>It is a great honour for a ſubiect, to be imployed in any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his prince; but it is much more, to be alwaies neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, in his chamber of Preſence, and in his Priuie chamber. Who therfore can expreſſe the honor of Gods children, to be in heauen it ſelfe, Gods Priuie chamber, and alwaies to behold his glory and excellency? But of this further communion of Gods children with God and Chriſt Ieſus, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo with the holy angels, more ſhall be ſpoken afterward.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, this ſhall ſuffice to haue beene ſpoken of theſe circumſtances, of the inheritance of Gods children.</p>
               <p>Now to ſpeake more largely of the ſaid inheritance it ſelfe, and ſo to come euen to the more ample declaration of their foreſaid communion with God, let vs vnderſtand, the ſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, to be the greater honour becauſe it is called <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of God:</hi> and men therby, in the two firſt places before alleadged, are called the heires of God. The greater that any man is in the world, the greater thing it is to bee heire vnto him; how great a thing then is it to be the heire of God?</p>
               <p>Herein the children of God differ from the children of men, and of great men in the world; euen from <hi>the ſonnes of the mightie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as they are called, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. 1. For there is no man ſo great or mightie, but that hauing many children, there is but one amongſt them all accounted the heire. But the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:18428:162"/> of God, though they be many <hi>euen as the ſtarres of heauen, and the ſand by the ſeaſhore: Gen.</hi> 15. 5. and 22. 17. yet they are all heires.</p>
               <p>Yea, whereas great men, hauing both ſonnes and daughters diuide their inheritance (for the moſt part) onely amongſt their ſonnes: (though alſo of many ſonnes they make but one heire) and doe but giue portions of mony to their daughters: here the daughters of God ſhall be heires as well as the ſonnes of God. The reaſon of this community of inheritance of all the children of God, is from the like communion betwixt Chriſt himſelfe and them. The children of men are all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one children in themſelues; they are not children by the eldeſt, or by the heire: but the children of God are not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in themſelues, but only in Chriſt (as before hath been ſhewed) <hi>in whom all are one, both male and female: Galat.</hi> 3. 28.</p>
               <p>There is yet another difference, viz. that whereas the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men do inherit only when their parents die, by whom their inheritance commeth vnto them (ſometimes the Father, ſomtimes the mother) all the children of God do inherit, their father (God himſelfe) liuing with them for euer.</p>
               <p>Againe, whereas ſomtimes the children of men may indeed be all ſaid to be heires; yet the inheritances of them are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed one from another, the eldeſt hauing his inheritance by himſelfe, and euery one of the other hauing his ſeuerall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: the eldeſt being ſomtimes heire to all the freeland: and the yongeſt to all the copy hold, &amp;c. But the children of God are all heires of one and the ſame inheritance: yea, <hi>they are heires</hi> (as I ſayd) <hi>annexed with Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> the only ſonne of God by nature: Euen by him are they heires (through adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in him) of the ſame inheritance whereof he is heire: in which reſpect their inheritance is called <hi>the kingdome of Chriſt and of God: Epheſ.</hi> 5. 5. Neither can it be otherwiſe, ſith before we heard <hi>they are made one with Chriſt, and in Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a great dignity: This is a wonderfull prerogatiue: and ſuch as is the perfection of all other, and wherein all the former (or the moſt of them) doe ceaſe. Yea, this is ſuch, that the very Angels of heauen are ſaid (as it were) <hi>to put forth their
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:18428:162"/> necks and</hi> (in ſome ſort) <hi>to stretch out themſelues to behold it: 1. Pet.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p>It is much that before we heard, that many of Chriſts titles are communicated to the children of God: but this is much more: namely <hi>that the inheritance of Chriſt, euen the kingdome of God</hi> in heauen is theirs. For herein eſpecially doth that their kingly dignity (before handled) conſiſt, as before hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>This inheritance was typically fore-ſignified, and ſhadowed out to the Iſraelites, by the land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> and therefore it is called by this name of <hi>an inheritance:</hi> which properly ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a diuiſion made by lot. So is the future condition of Gods children called, that it might the better appeare to haue been before repreſented by the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which according to the commandement of God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 26. 55. and 33. 54. was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by <hi>Lot</hi> diuided when the Iſraelites came to the poſſeſſion of it: <hi>Ioſh. 14. 2. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So would the Lord haue that land to be diuided, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing therof vpon the Iſraelites, might be imputed only to Gods goodneſſe, not to any merit or worthineſſe of their own. For <hi>The lot being wholly diſpoſed according to the pleaſure of the Lord: Pro.</hi> 16. 33. what merit can there be imagined for any thing that falleth thereby? So the Lord would much more teach them, that if the type were without reſpect of any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe in them, much more the kingdom of heauen ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by the type was to be imputed to the only free and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious gift of God: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. where the word tranſlated <hi>the gift of God,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>the free gift of God, or a gift of the free grace of God.</hi> This doth not a little amplifie and increaſe the dignity of the children of God. The greater gifts that a Prince giueth freely vnto any ſubiect, the more doth ſuch a Prince honor ſuch a ſubiect: How great a grace then and dignity is this, for the children of God to be heires of the kingdom of God, only by the grace and free gift of God? without any price giuen for it? without any merit, deſert, and worthineſſe of it?</p>
               <p>As the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth appropriate this inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance onelie to them <hi>Whom God the Father of his rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie hath begotten againe: 1. Pet.</hi> 1. 3. 4. ſo doth our
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:18428:163"/> Sauiour by one ſentence twice with great vehemency repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Nicodemus, Verely, verely, I ſay vnto thee, except a man bee borne againe, he cannot ſee the kingdome of God:</hi> and the ſecond time, <hi>Verely, verely, I ſay vnto thee, except a man be borne of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God. Ioh.</hi> 3. 3. and 5. And againe our Sauiour ſaith not, <hi>Feare not little flocke, it is the Fathers pleaſure to giue a kingdome;</hi> but he putteth in the Pronowns, <hi>your,</hi> and <hi>you,</hi> ſaying, <hi>It is your Fathers will to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>giue you a kingdome: Luke</hi> 12. 32. Where the words. <hi>your Father,</hi> haue alſo relation onely to them that are his children, and which may call God their Father. Therefore alſo they that are ſo borne againe, are called by our Sauiour, <hi>the children of the kingdome, Matt.</hi> 13. 38.</p>
               <p>As it is high treaſon for any man to ſay that hee is heire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant to an earthly king, if he be not of the blood royall; ſo and much more is it high treaſon againſt the king of heauen and earth, for any man to boaſt that hee hopeth for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, which is not of the blood royall (that I may ſo ſpeake) of God himſelfe: that is, which by regeneration is none of Gods children.</p>
               <p>As in the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> after the returne of the people from captiuitie, ſome that <hi>would haue beene prieſts, ſought their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the generalogies, and could not be found, and were therefore put from the prieſthood:</hi> or rather, they were kept from it: <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. 62. So, whoſoeuer they be that would haue this inheritance, if by ſearching and examining their euidences by the word of God, they ſhall not find themſelues to bee new borne of God, they ſhall be ſure to be kept from the kingdome of God.</p>
               <p>This inheritance is Crowne-land; euen ſuch as is annexed to Chriſts owne crowne, and cannot bee alienated from it; no not by leaſe, or for any tearme of yeeres: therefore none can haue it, but ſuch as are members of Chriſt, and made one with Chriſt. As it is ſaid, that <hi>God cannot lie, Tit.</hi> 1. 2. ſo it may be ſaid, that neither God nor Chriſt can giue this inheritance to any, but onely to them, that beeing incorporated into Chriſt, and ſo made members of Chriſt, are alſo the children and heires of God.</p>

               <p>When the mother of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> petitioned to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour for her ſaid two ſonnes, <hi>that one might ſit at his right hand, the other at his left hand in his kingdome:</hi> that is, (becauſe ſhee dreamed Chriſts kingdome to be an earthly kingdome) that they might bee the two ſecond perſons next to himſelfe in his kingdome; one (as it were) the Lord Chancellor, and the other Lord Treaſurer: our Sauiour anſwered (after ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions had with them) that <hi>to ſit at his right hand, and at his left hand, was not his to giue: but ſhould be giuen to them for whom it was prepared of his father, Matth.</hi> 20. 20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What meant our Sauiour by this anſwere? Euen this, not only that he came to be an example and patterne of humilitie, and therefore not to take vpon him the beſtowing of earthly offices and dignities: neither onely, that to conferre or beſtowe theſe preferments of <hi>ſitting at his right hand, and at his left hand</hi> in his kingdome in heauen, was not in him, as hee was onely man (in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he denieth himſelfe to knowe the day and houre of his ſecond comming, <hi>Mar.</hi> 13. 32. and in which reſpect onely it ſeemed that this woman with her two ſonnes came vnto Chriſt, ſcarce ſo much as dreaming of his diuine nature, and of his kingdome in heauen) but he alſo meaneth, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction <note place="margin">Note.</note> and degrees of honour in the kingdome of heauen beeing already diſpoſed by his Father, <hi>viz.</hi> before all worlds, when he made his generall decree of election vnto ſaluation, it was not now in his power to alter or change the ſame. This (I ſay) ſeemeth plainely to haue beene the meaning of Chriſt, by the oppoſition which he maketh betwixt the deniall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to be in his hands, and the acknowledgement of the giuing thereof to them, <hi>for whom it was prepared of his Father.</hi> For ſo he ſignifieth, <hi>that the counſell of God touching the ſitting at the right hand or at the left hand of Chriſt, ſhould ſtand,</hi> &amp; could no more be altered by Chriſt himſelfe, than the general decree of God, <hi>of election and reprobation.</hi> If then Chriſt cannot alter the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, touching the particular place of any in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, by giuing that degree of honour to one that the Father had prepared for another; how much leſſe can hee giue the inheritance of his kingdome generally to any, for whom God hath not prepared the ſame?</p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:18428:164"/>
               <p>To ſpeake yet more of this inheritance of the children of God, as it is ſaid of <hi>Abſalom</hi> (in reſpect of his beauty) <hi>that there was none in all Iſrael, to be ſo much praiſed for beauty, as Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom, and that from the ſole of the foote to the crowne of the head, there was no blemiſh in him:</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 25. ſo it may be ſaid of this inheritance touching the perfection thereof, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the inheritances of the world, there is none ſo much to be praiſed as this inheritance (wherof now we ſpeak) of the children of God: becauſe from one end to another, and from one ſide to another, there is no blemiſh in it. That which <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh of his portion, as he was one of Gods children, may all and euery one of Gods children ſay of this inheritance. <hi>The lines are fallen vnto me in pleaſant places, yea I haue a faire heritage: Pſal.</hi> 16. 6.</p>
               <p>All this is manifeſt by thoſe foure attributes whereby <hi>Peter</hi> deſcribeth and commendeth this inheritance, calling it <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, vndefiled, not withering, reſerued in heauen:</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Of what inheritance, of what kingdome in all the world, can all theſe things, or any of theſe things be truly ſpoken?</p>
               <p>Neither is this inheritance thus commended in reſpect of it ſelfe only, but alſo in reſpect of all things therein. For are not all things in this inheritance, <hi>immortall, vndefiled, not wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, and heauenly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſpeake particularly and briefly of the former commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations: Firſt it is called <hi>immortall,</hi> becauſe it is euerlaſting and without end, as before we heard the condemnation of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to be. Though it haue a beginning, yet it ſhall continue for euer. How long ſoeuer any ſhall be in poſſeſſion thereof, yet the time ſtill remaining, ſhall be more then the time paſt.</p>
               <p>What an excellent commendation this is, may (without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amplification) appeare by that before ſpoken of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, in reſpect of the ſame circumſtance.</p>
               <p>In earthly benefits, as here this commendation for time is ſet firſt, ſo we do firſt enquire, how long any thing will laſt. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing is accounted the better, the more durable the ſame is. Of euils, the longer is more feared and ſhunned: of good things, the longer is more deſired and laboured for. In que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of leaſes, other things being like, the longer is more
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:18428:164"/> worth. Lands in fee ſimple to a man and his heires are more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, then leaſes or other chattels.</p>
               <p>As this inheritance is immortall in it ſelfe, ſo it ſhall be to the children of God, for whom it is prepared; and that are borne vnto it: becauſe they alſo ſhall be made immortall, as well in their bodies, as they are already in their ſoules: that ſo they may enioy it for euer in their own perſons for their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and for their ſoules: and not in the perſon of any heires or ſucceſſors: as it is in the inheritances of this world. But of this more afterward, vpon the ſecond verſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond attribute, <hi>vndefiled,</hi> ſignifieth that there is no ſpot or blemiſh in it. Yea, as the originall word being ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely taken (as ſomtimes it is) ſignifieth a certaine gemme or pretious ſtone, that is vncapable of any pollution, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt into the fire, will neither be corrupted nor waſted; ſo may it be ſaid of this inheritance. Yea, it is ſo pure, that as it is ſaid of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that it will not ſuffer any toad, ſnake, adder, or any other venemous thing in it, ſo this inheritance will not admit or entertaine any thing, that is polluted or defiled. <hi>This I ſay brethren</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) that fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the kingdome of God: neither doth corruption inherit incorruption: 1. Cor.</hi> 15. 50.</p>
               <p>This attribute ſeemeth to be a reaſon of the former. For as any thing is pure and vndefiled, ſo it is alſo durable. And that which is altogether pure and vndefiled, is alſo altogether durable, that is, immortall, and euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>This word alſo being vnderſtood of this inheritance not only in it ſelfe, but in reſpect of the heires that ſhall enioy it, importeth that when once they ſhall come to the full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof, they ſhall be altogether freed from ſorrow and labor, whereto here they were ſubiect, ſo long as themſelues were defiled, and ſo long as they liued here, where all things by them are polluted and defiled. This is manifeſt by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of one of the Elders vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> touching them which he had ſeen <hi>arraied in long white robes. Theſe are they</hi> (ſaith the Elder) <hi>which came out of great tribulation, and haue waſhed their long robes, and haue made their long robes white in the bloud of the Lamb</hi> (that is, which are clenſed of all their pollution, and are
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:18428:165"/> become vndefiled) then he addeth (as an appendix and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the former) <hi>They ſhall hunger no more, nor thirſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, neither ſhall the Sunne light on them: nor any heat</hi> (viz. to ſcorch or hurt them) <hi>for the Lambe which is in the midſt of the throne, ſhall gouerne them, and ſhall lead them to the liuely foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of waters, and God ſhall wipe away all teares from their eies: Reuel.</hi> 17. 13. 14. 16. 17. So we are taught that in this inheritance there is no defect, no ſorrow or griefe. What kingdome in the world is comparable? What King euer was there, that ſometimes hath not wanted? and that ſometimes hath not mourned and wept?</p>
               <p>Touching labour both of ſinne it ſelfe, and of all afflictions and miſery by ſinne, another voice likewiſe from heauen ſaid vnto <hi>Iohn, Writ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, Bleſſed from hencefort</hi> (or preſently) <hi>are they which die in the Lord, for they reſt from their labors: Reuel.</hi> 14 13. In this inheritance therefore, there ſhall be no ſorrow, no griefe, no paine: not ſo much as a tooth, or a little finger ſhall ake. All ſhall be eaſe and comfort. Sinne the cauſe of all want, griefe and paine being taken away, all effects alſo muſt ceaſe. Is there any other ſuch inheritance in all the world? What a ſingular priuiledge therefore is this of this inheritance to bee ſo vndefiled, and whereof likewiſe the heires themſelues ſhall be vndefiled?</p>
               <p>The third attribute <hi>(not withering)</hi> is added, as for further direct commendation of the inheritance it ſelfe, ſo likewiſe to amplifie the firſt attribute, <hi>immortall,</hi> by a compariſon of the leſſe. For it ſignifieth that this inheritance ſhall not only be <hi>immortall,</hi> but that alſo it ſhall not ſo much as <hi>wither,</hi> or rather (according to the naturall ſignification of the word) that it cannot be made <hi>to wither.</hi> As the originall word is ſomtime taken, for a kind of flowre, which will neuer wither (like to that amongſt vs which is called <hi>ſemper viuens,</hi> or the euerlaſting flowre, becauſe it being gathered and kept in the houſe, euer without water or any other moiſture, it retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the beauty it had at the time of gathering) ſo the beauty &amp; glory of this inheritance, ſhall neuer fade, wither, or decay; but continue the ſame for euer, in the whole, and in euery part, that it was at their firſt entrance, that ſhalbe heires therof.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:18428:165"/> It ſhall not loſe ſo much as one leafe, neither ſhall any leafe growe lithe, and ſo hang down from the fellowes. What an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie is this? What kingdome was there euer in the world, but that was in time impaired and blemiſhed, either by loſſe of ſome part thereof, or by not retaining the glory it had at the firſt? How was the glorious kingdome of Iſrael, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after <hi>Salomons</hi> time maymed by the falling away of ten tribes at once from the houſe of <hi>Dauid?</hi> How was the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <hi>Iudah</hi> afterward defaced, partly by often giuing the treaſure of the Lord, to make peace with forraine nations, and partly and principally in the captiuity by the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, when their city Ieruſalem (before, the glory of the world) was ſacked and deſtroyed, their noble and moſt famous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple burnt with fire, and their princes and nobles partly ſlaine, and partly in moſt ſlauiſh manner carried into a ſtrange land?</p>
               <p>I alleadge no particular Scriptures for proofe of theſe things, becauſe the whole booke of <hi>Ieremiahs Lamentations</hi> doth moſt lamentably deſcribe them.</p>
               <p>The ſame may be ſaid of the kingdome of Babel, of the kingdome of the Medes and Perſians, of the kingdome of Greece, of the great empire of Rome; all which are not onely waſted and decayed, but alſo vtterly conſumed, the ſtampe onely of the Romane empire yet remaining.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt attribute, <hi>reſerued</hi> or <hi>preſerued,</hi> noteth the ſafetie of this inheritance, illuſtrated or confirmed by the place, <hi>in heauen.</hi> For all things <hi>in heauen</hi> are out of danger and gun-ſhot of any enemies whatſoeuer: <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 20. That attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute <hi>(reſerued)</hi> beeing ſo illuſtrated or confirmed by the place, is alſo amplified by the perſons for whom it is ſo reſerued: <hi>viz. for vs:</hi> that is, for them whom before he had ſaid <hi>God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had begotten againe,</hi> and made his children. The attribute it ſelfe <hi>(reſerued)</hi> noting the ſafetie of this inheritance, is of the time perfectly paſt, &amp; ſo inſinuateth that this inheritance hath <note place="margin">Note.</note> bin kept a long time for the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, according to the words of our Sauiour, ſaying, <hi>it was prepared from the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world for them that were bleſſed of his Father, Mat.</hi> 25. 34. and according to the words of the ſame Apoſtle in the end
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:18428:166"/> of the very next verſe, where he calleth the ſaid <hi>inheritance, the ſaluation which is prepared to be ſhewed in the laſt time.</hi> Sith ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this inheritance hath been ſo long kept for the children of God, they may the better aſſure themſelues of it. For the long keeping of any thing for another, doth the better teſtifie the full purpoſe of the keeper, that ſuch ſhall haue it, as for whom he hath kept it ſo long. Daily experience confirmeth this, that it needeth no other proofe.</p>
               <p>The place, <hi>in heauen</hi> doth not onely further confirme the ſaid ſafety, but is alſo a reaſon of the former three attributes. For as all things in earth are mortall, defiled, and do daily wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo all things in heauen are <hi>immortall, vndefiled, and free from all withering.</hi> Yea, it further commendeth the excellencie of this inheritance, as ſhewing, that as high as the heauen is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the earth, ſo and much more excellent is this heauenly inheritance, then all earthly inheritances.</p>
               <p>The pronoune <hi>vs,</hi> referred to the worke of regeneration before ſpoken, doth plainly note (as I ſaid) a ſpeciall reſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and preparation (long before, euen before all worlds) of the ſaid inheritance, only for them that are regenerated, and ſo made the children of God. What a great benefit is this, that we ſhall haue it, all of vs, and not any other? <hi>euen wee that are the ſonnes of the free woman, borne by promiſe: and that none comming of the bond woman, and borne after the fleſh: Galat.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>ſhall be heires</hi> (or haue any part of this inheritance) with vs? <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 21. 10. The which is alſo manifeſt by the conſtancy of <hi>Iſack</hi> in bleſſing <hi>Iacob,</hi> without any reuocation or diuiſion afterward of the ſaid bleſſing betwixt <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau:</hi> without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (I ſay) either as touching the whole bleſſing, or tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching any part thereof, though <hi>Eſau</hi> ſought the repentance of his father in that behalfe with teares: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17. But of this propriety of this inheritance to the children of God only, ſufficient hath been ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Now that our comfort may yet be the more touching the ſaid inheritance, let vs obſerue, that the Apoſtle ſaith not only that that inheritance is ſo kept for vs, but that alſo in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next verſe, viz. 5. he ſaith, that albeit we are here in earth in the middeſt, and thickeſt of our enemies <hi>(compaſſing vs about
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:18428:166"/> like mighty bulls of Baſhan, and like dogs: Pſal.</hi> 22. 12. and 16, and <hi>as thicke as bees: Pſal.</hi> 118. 12.) and albeit in that reſpect, whiles we thus hue amongſt our enemies, wee are ſubiect to many dangers, yet we are as ſafely kept, and as it were garded (euen walled round about) not by Angels alone, but by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; yea, the better to aſſure vs that we ſhall be as ſafely kept here in earth (notwithſtanding all our enemies) for that inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, as that is kept for vs, he ſaith that <hi>we are kept by the power of God.</hi> So ſaith our Sauiour, that <hi>he will giue his ſheepe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, and that they ſhall not periſh, neither that any man ſhall plucke them out of his hands,</hi> becauſe <hi>the father that hath giuen them vnto him is greater then all, and no man ſhall plucke them</hi> (by any violence) <hi>out of his hand: Ioh.</hi> 10. 28. 29.</p>
               <p>So then the ſheep of Chriſt, and children of God, are in the hands and cuſtody of God the Father, and God the Sonne. They may therefore as well doubt of the power of God, as of their preſeruation for the inheritance now ſpoken of. O inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable happineſſe! Without the former preſeruation of this inheritance for vs, it is ſmall comfort to heare it to be <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, vndefiled, and not withering:</hi> yea, the more excellent that this inheritance is noted to be by thoſe three attributes, the more would be our griefe, if it were not ſafely kept for vs. What comfort alſo ſhould we haue by all the foure former commendations, if we our ſelues might in the meane time periſh, and miſcarry? Alas what comfort had king <hi>Edward</hi> the fift by this great kingdome, when himſelfe was in the cuſtody of his moſt wicked vnkle, <hi>Richard</hi> the third, that moſt vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and horribly murthered him and his yonger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>Beſides all before written of this inheritance, the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thereof is laid foorth further in Scripture by phraſes of ſuch things, as are in greateſt regard, here vpon earth: and chiefly by ſuch things as belong to kings and kingdomes.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſaid (as before we heard) <hi>that we ſhall be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in white: that we ſhall haue crownes vpon our heads: and that we ſhall ſit vpon thrones, yea, on the throne of Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe.</hi> Becauſe kings alſo fare daintily, therefore it is ſaid, that the children of God <hi>ſhall eat of the fruit of the tree of life, which is
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:18428:167"/> in the midſt of the paradiſe of God: Ren. 2. 7.</hi> and <hi>of the Manna, that is hidden. Reuel. 2. 17.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As alſo in the Courts of Princes there is <hi>the voice of ſinging men and women: 2. Sam.</hi> 19. 32. ſo in heauen all the Saints, and all the Angels <hi>ſhall ſing a new ſong, and the ſong of Moſes and of the Lamb: Reuel.</hi> 5. 9. 10. 11. and 14. 3. where there is mention of harpes, and of a new ſong; yea, ſuch a ſong <hi>that no man could learne, but the elect bought from the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas Princes alſo dwell in ſtately and princely pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: lift vp thy eies to heauen, behold the beauty and glory thereof: and conſider whether the inſide of the greateſt and moſt ſumptuous palaces in all the world, with all their rich and ſumptuous furniture, be comparable to the outſide of heauen. If the outſide be ſo beautifull and glorious, are not the inner parts where God himſelfe with all his Angels are in all glory, much more beautifull and glorious?</p>
               <p>How doth <hi>Dauid</hi> oft times commend the houſe of God vpon earth? Doth he not ſpeake of the tabernacle before the temple was built, by way of admiration: <hi>O Lord of hoſts, how amiable are thy tabernacles! Pſal.</hi> 84. 1. Doth not he therefore pronounce them <hi>Bleſſed that might dwell in his houſe?</hi> verſe 4. yea doth he not ſay, that <hi>a day in the courts of God, is better then a thouſand elſewhere?</hi> and that for his part, though hee were then annointed heire apparant to the crowne and diadem of the kingdome of Iſrael, yet he <hi>had rather bee a doore-keeper in the houſe of his God, then to dwell in the tabernacles of wickedneſſe?</hi> verſe 10. If he thought the houſe of God ſo amiable vpon earth, which is (as it were) but the gatehouſe of heauen, how amiable thought he heauen it ſelfe to be?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glorious things</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>are ſpoken of thee thou ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God: Pſal.</hi> 87. 3. what city of God? The earthly Ieruſalem. What glorious things are ſpoken of that city? That <hi>it is built as a city compact together in it ſelfe, that thereunto the tribes of the Lord goe vp, according to the teſtimony to Iſrael,</hi> (or of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites) <hi>to praiſe the name of the Lord,</hi> and that <hi>there are thrones ſet for iudgement, the thrones of the houſe of Dauid: Pſal.</hi> 122. 3. 4. 5. Were theſe and many other the like glorious things ſpoken of the city of God, and of Ieruſalem vpon earth? What then
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:18428:167"/> may be ſaid of the City of God, and of the Ieruſalem of God in heauen? That was but a type; this is the thing ſignified. That was corruptible, and is now deſtroied; this abideth for euer: That was an habitation for a time for corrupt and mortall men; this is an euerlaſting habitation of God himſelfe in his glory, for all the Angels, and for all the Saints purged of all their ſinnes, and made glorious, without any ſpot or wrinkle: That was made by men and with hands; this was made by God himſelfe without hands. That had goodly towers, almoſt paſt numbring: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. 12. this likewiſe hath <hi>many dwelling places,</hi> more artificially compact together then all the gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous palaces of Ieruſalem, or of all the Princes in the world. Thither <hi>the tribes of Iſrael did goe vp:</hi> but hither all tribes of all nations vnder heauen are and ſhall be gathered <hi>to praiſe the name of the Lord by ſinging thoſe ſongs</hi> before ſpoken of. There were <hi>the thrones of Dauid:</hi> but here is <hi>the throne of Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> for the iudgement of all the world. What ſhall I ſay more? When we ſhall come to this inheritance, though the happy ſtate thereof be deſcribed by ſuch things as are vpon earth in greateſt price (for our better capacity) yet for all that, no ſuch things are ſufficient to ſet forth, and fully to expreſſe the thouſandth part of the excellency thereof. <hi>The eie of man hath not ſeen, neither hath the eare of man heard, neither can the things enter in to the heart of man, which God hath prepared for them that loue him:</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. What tongue then of man, by any thing, or by all things in the world is able to expreſſe them?</p>
               <p>Yea, the truth is, that albeit the future condition of the children of God be deſcribed by <hi>white raiment, by eating of the fruit of the tree of life, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>of the Manna that is hidden, &amp;c.</hi> yet we ſhall neither haue apparrell nor food for our bodies in the world to come.</p>
               <p>As man before his fall, liued by corporall food without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and after his fall had need as well of apparell to couer his nakedneſſe, as of meat to nouriſh him: ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the children of God ſhall liue without either of both: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meat, and without apparell.</p>
               <p>As concerning mariage it is ſaid, that <hi>In the reſurrection they neither marry wiues, nor wiues are beſtowed in mariage, but that
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:18428:168"/> they ſhalbe as the Angels of God in heauen: Mat.</hi> 22. 30. ſo ſhall it be for meat and apparell. The children of God ſhall liue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer without both. There ſhall be neither cold, nor hunger, nor thirſt. <hi>Their bodies that are ſowen naturall bodies ſhalbe raiſed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bodies.</hi> They ſhall ſtil be bodies, &amp; the ſame bodies in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that they were before: (otherwiſe how could it be ſaid that they are raiſed againe?) but touching their qualities, as they ſhall be changed many other waies, ſo alſo this way, that <hi>they ſhall be ſpirituall bodies,</hi> that is, ſuch as ſhall not liue by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall meats, as vpon the earth they did: but altogether by the immediat vertue of the ſpirit, euen as the Angels do now liue in heauen.</p>
               <p>This then in the life to come, ſhall be the perfection of the children of God, that they ſhall need no outward meanes for their euerlaſting maintenance and preſeruation: as here they did for their maintenance and preſeruation for a time: yea, for a ſhort time: which for the ſhortneſſe thereof, is not worthy to be called halfe a time.</p>
               <p>So hauing nothing, they ſhall be ten thouſand times more happy then they were here hauing many things. Men are not ſo happy here by hauing many things, as they ſhall be in the world to come by needing nothing. I meane no ſuch outward things, as without which before they could not liue.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate this by a familiar ſimilitude: As a man being in poore ſtate and in a meane calling here in this world (as a ſhoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, a tailer, a husbandman, or ſuch like) ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not liue without ſuch things, as appertain to ſuch trades (as the ſhoemaker can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not liue without his laſt, cutting-knife &amp; awle: the tailer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his ſheers and preſſing yron: the husbandman without his ſpade, mattock, flaile, plough, hedging bill, &amp;c.) but yet the ſame man being aduanced to welth &amp; higher calling amongſt men, hath none of the former things; and yet is not the worſe, but the better, becauſe he needeth no ſuch things now, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which before he could not liue: ſo the children of God in the life to come, being in full poſſeſſion of their inheritance, ſhall be neuer a whit the worſe, becauſe they ſhall haue no meat, nor apparell, nor any other ſuch outward thing for maintenance and preſeruation of their ſtate as here they had:
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:18428:168"/> but they ſhall be ſo much the more happy and bleſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall need no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Beſides all hitherto ſpoken of the happy and bleſſed inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the children of God in the world and life to come, whereas here they had the company of men, yea oft times of wretched &amp; wicked men, ſuch as of whom they might cry out, as we heare <hi>Dauid</hi> did, <hi>Woe is to vs that we haue them in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: Our ſoules haue too long dwelt with them:</hi> in the life to come, in ſtead of ſuch company, they ſhall haue the ſociety &amp; fellowſhip of the bleſſed Angels, the leaſt wherof is more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, then euer was <hi>Salomon</hi> in al his roialty; or then are al the kings &amp; Princes in the world, when they ſhew themſelues moſt in al their kingly and princely robes &amp; glory: yea, then (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we heard) they ſhall haue perfect communion with God himſelfe, <hi>Father, Son, and holy ghoſt:</hi> and they ſhall ſee Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus God and man, in all his glory, &amp; be alſo themſelues in their own perſons partaker therof (as we ſhal hear more at large vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſecond verſe following) they ſhal (I ſay) ſee Chriſt Ieſus in al his glory, &amp; be themſelues partaker therof, according to the praier of Chriſt himſelf for them in that behalfe: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 22. 23 24.</p>
               <p>How ſweet, happy, &amp; comfortable a thing is this! when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw Chriſt but a little transfigured in the mountain, and <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Elias</hi> in ſome glory talking with him; how were they affected? how were they rauiſhed? How did <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſay (in the name of the reſt) <hi>Maſter it is good for vs to be here: If thou wilt let vs make here three tabernacles, &amp;c? Mat.</hi> 17. 4. were they thus affected? were they ſo rauiſhed? did they ſo deſire ſtil to dwell in the mountain, and to enioy the ſight only of Chriſt and of two of his Saints, themſelues being yet clogged with their ſins, and cloathed with corruption &amp; mortality? Oh how happy then ſhall that day be, when the children of God ſhall ſee Chriſt Ieſus in his perfect glory, accompanied and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon with millions, and many millions of moſt glorious Angels: and when themſelues alſo ſhall haue put on incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and immortality; and according to their degree and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be alſo crowned with a crowne of the ſame glory!</p>
               <p>The Prophet amongſt diuers other arguments wherby he
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:18428:169"/> prouoketh <hi>all the ſeruants of the Lord, to praiſe the name of the Lord,</hi> ſetteth downe this for one, that <hi>The Lord raiſeth the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy out of the duſt, and lifteth vp the poore out of the dung, that hee may ſet him with the Princes, euen with the princes of the people: Pſal</hi> 113. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Was it, and is it ſo great a dignity, ſo great an honour, ſo great an aduancement, to make poore men to ſit with Princes in this world? What then is the dignity, honor, and aduancement of the children of God, to ſit with God and with Chriſt Ieſus, and with all the holy Angels in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens?</p>
               <p>It is here alſo to be conſidered, that this inheritance is ſo ample and ſo excellent, that how few ſoeuer ſhall enioy the ſame, they ſhall haue neuer a whit the more: and how many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <note place="margin">Note.</note> ſhall be admitted thereunto, none ſhall haue any whit the leſſe. In all earthly inheritances it is far otherwiſe: yea cleane contrary. The fewer they are amongſt whom any inheritance is diuided, the greater is the portion of euery one. And the more the heires of any inheritance are, (how ample ſoeuer the ſame be) the leſſe is the portion of euery one.</p>
               <p>All hitherto ſaid, or which can be ſaid: yea more then any tongue can ſpeake, or then any heart can conceiue, is the more in reſpect of the certainty thereof.</p>
               <p>Nothing in this world, though it be in preſent poſſeſſion, is ſo certaine, as all ſpoken before of this inheritance. For the certainty of faith is much greater, then the certainty of ſenſe and humane reaſon.</p>
               <p>This certainty of this inheritance, and of the things before ſpoken thereof doth not only depend vpon that before writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the ſafety both of the inheritance it ſelfe, and of the children of God to whom the ſame inheritance belongeth: but alſo vpon diuers expreſſe ſcriptures and vpon diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons.</p>

               <p>Touching other arguments: Firſt the immutable conſtancy of God confirmeth the certainty of the inheritance of Gods children. <hi>God is not as man, that he ſhold lie, neither as the Sonne of man that he ſhould repent: hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not doe it? and hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he not accompliſh it?

               <p>
                  <hi>The gifts and callings of God are without repentance: Rom. 11. 29. God is faithfull: 2. Theſ. 3. 3. With God is no variableneſſe nor ſhadow of turning: Iames 1. 17. He is faithfull that hath promiſed, Heb.</hi> 10. 23.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in reſpect of Gods promiſe, in reſpect of Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ath, in reſpect of the earneſt and pledge of Gods ſpirit giuen vnto vs, to ſeale vs to the day of redemption: in reſpect of the great price that Chriſt hath giuen, and God the father hath receiued for this inheritance for vs all that are Gods children: in reſpect of Chriſts former prayer for it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 20. which God the father alwaies heareth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. 22. and 42. and in reſpect alſo of his daily interceſsion in the behalfe for vs at the right hand of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. it ſtandeth not onely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mercie of God, to make this their inheritance certaine, but alſo vpon his righteouſneſſe, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the children of God (all and euery one) are the members of Chriſts body, as before hath beene ſhewed: As therefore it is impoſſible for any power to take away any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſts glorified body in heauen; ſo is it impoſſible for any power to take away any member of his myſticall body in earth. The ſouldiers that brake the bones of the two theeues that were crucified with Chriſt, could not for their liues break the bones of Chriſt, becauſe it was written: <hi>Not a bone of him ſhall bee broken: Iohn</hi> 19. 33. 36. Could not a bone of his naturall body be broken by the malice and violence of all his aduerſaries, armed with the power of hell it ſelfe, and that becauſe the Scriptures had ſaid in one place that <hi>a bone of him ſhould not bee broken?</hi> How then ſhall it bee poſſible for any member of his myſticall body coupled together by the eternall and all powerfull ſpirit, to be altogether taken away and depriued of that inheritance which God hath prepared for it? eſpecially ſith the Scripture hath not in one place, but in many places ſaid, that not one of them ſhall periſh? I might adde many other arguments for further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this certainty: but becauſe the next verſe of my text offereth fit occaſion to ſpeake againe thereof, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the meane time I will content my ſelfe with theſe. This
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:18428:170"/> notwithſtanding I may further adde for the better amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the dignity of Gods children by this certainty of their inheritance, viz. that thereby in pouerty they are made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: in abundance they are ſober and wary: in the enmity of other againſt them, they are couragious and magnanimous: and in afflictions they are cheerfull and comfortable.</p>
               <p>By all hitherto ſaid of this inheritance, who ſeeth not the exceeding dignity, and moſt honorable condition of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God? On the contrary, as the ſtate of the children of God is the better by their freedome from the condemnation beforeſpoken of, although they ſhould neuer come to this great inheritance; ſo the ſtate of all naturall and wicked men, is the more baſe, the more vile, the more wofull, and the more fearefull, becauſe (though it were poſſible they ſhould not be ſo condemned, as before we heard they ſhall be, yet) they ſhall haue no part of this inheritance, but ſhall be vtterly caſt out and excluded: <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 21. 10. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 22. 15. to whom it ſhall be ſaid (whatſoeuer they ſhall plead for themſelues from their great workes <hi>of prophecying in Chriſts name, and caſting out diuels in his name, &amp;c.) I neuer knew you, Depart from me ye that worke iniquity: Mat.</hi> 7. 22. 23. and 25. 12.</p>
               <p>Thus much of this inheritance, and of the benefits of the children of God in the life to come.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the peace of conſcience in the children of God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough I haue heretofore ſpoken of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſingular benefits of the children of God both for this life and the life to come; yet there remaineth one more of great price and excellency, without which all the former ſpoken of for this life or for the life to come, enjoyed in this life, are of leſſe reckoning. This is peace of conſcience accompanied with exceeding ioy; of this the Apoſtle ſpeaketh as of a fruit of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes and iuſtification before handled. <hi>Being iuſtified faith</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we haue peace towards God: Rom.</hi> 5. 11.
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:18428:171"/> yet it is not only a fruit of iuſtification, but alſo of all or of moſt of all, at leaſt of the knowledge of all or of moſt of all the benefits before declared. For not only being iuſtified by faith haue we this peace of conſcience, but alſo by faith being made one with Chriſt, and in Chriſt being quickned and freed from ſinne, made wiſe, holy, and righteous, and hauing freedom to trade for heauen and heauenly things, being made the children of God in ſpeciall manner to glorifie God: being ſo incorporated into Chriſt, that we haue alſo communion with the father and the holy ghoſt: ſuch a communion with all the three perſons as ſhall continue for euer; ſuch alſo as is repreſented vnto vs by many excellent ſimilitudes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our dignity is made more manifeſt, in reſpect wereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Chriſts names and honorable titles are communicated vnto vs: as alſo whereby we haue liberty with boldneſſe to aske at all times any thing for vs at the hand of God, with better aſſurance of obtaining it, the greater the thing is we aske: yea whereby we are freed from all the euills of this life (as they are euills) and haue right to all the bleſſings of this life: and laſtly whereby we are freed from euerlaſting condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are made heires of the kingdome of heauen. Hauing (I ſay) this manner of communion with Chriſt, and all other benefits and prerogatiues of the children of God hither to ſpoken of, we haue this peace of conſcience and ioy of heart whereof we are now to ſpeake. So this peace and ioy being fruits of all the former things, I haue therefore reſerued the handling thereof for this place after all before written.</p>
               <p>From hence, that this peace and ioy are fruits of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer benefits, it followeth, that as we haue heard all the former to be proper to the children of God, ſo theſe are in none other to be found but only in them. Where there is not nor euer was the cauſe, there cannot be the effect: Secondly, this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle expreſly teacheth, oppoſing theſe two, one to the other: the ſpirit of <hi>bondage and the ſpirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba father: Rom.</hi> 8. 15. ſo nothing firſt that the ſpirit of bondage vnto ſinne, is the ſpirit offeare: Secondly, that they that are freed from <hi>that ſpirit of bondage</hi> and haue receiued <hi>the ſpirit of adepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereby they cry Abb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> father,</hi> are freed from the former ſpirit
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:18428:171"/> of feare. There being therefore ſuch an oppoſition betwixt theſe two, there can bee no agreement. As therfore all the children of God are freed from the ſpirit of feare, ſo they onelie are freed from the ſpirit of feare. Hence alſo it followeth, that all the children of God and they only haue this peace whereof wee ſpeake. For they that are freed from feare muſt needs haue peace: and they that are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with the ſpirit of feare, cannot poſſibly bee at peace. To ſpeake yet further of this peace, let vs conſider that the children of God hauing (as hath beene ſhewed) Chriſt himſelfe, they can no more bee without this peace, then without the life, the light, the knowledge, the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the holineſſe, the righteouſneſſe, the liberty, and other things before ſpoken of. This is euident, becauſe Chriſt is called <hi>the Prince of peace: Iſat</hi> 9, 6: can any haue the Prince of peace, and bee without peace? Is it not expected that where there is in any companie a Iuſtice of peace, there all ſhould bee at peace, and none ſhould breake the peace? how then can wee doubt of peace to be there, where there is and dwelleth the Prince of peace him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? When Chriſt was new borne into the world, and laie in his ſwadling clouts, hauing done nothing in his owne perſon, to wards our reconciliation and ſaluation (his in carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and comming into the world only excepted) is not this a part of the ſong, that the Angels with <hi>the multitude of heauenly ſouldiers did ſing. in the hearing of the ſhepheards, Peace on earth, as well as glory to God in high? Luk.</hi> 2. 14. Hauing now by the bloud of his Croſſe, made that peace which was then proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Coloſſ</hi> 1. 20. how much more may men and Angels, ſing and ſay not only peace in earth, but alſo peace in the heart of euery child of God? Verely, all the children of God may the better bee at peace in their hearts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prince of peace Chriſt Ieſus, in his owne perſon hath ſaid to his diſeiples (and in them to all that belong vnto him) <hi>peace I leaue with you, my peace I giue vnto you: not as the world giueth, giue I vnto you: let not your hearts bee troubled nor greeued: Iohn</hi> 14. 27. It is much that hee had ſaid before by his Prophet, <hi>The worke of inſtice ſhall be peace, euen the worke
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:18428:172"/> of iuſtice &amp; quietneſſe, and aſſurance for euer; and my people ſhall dwell in the tabernacles of peace, &amp;c. Iſai</hi> 32. 17. 18. But this that he ſpeaketh in his owne perſon is much more. As this peace is thus manifeſt to belong to all the children of God, ſo that it is proper only to them, and that the wicked haue no part in it, doth further appeare, becauſe the Lord ſaith that <hi>there is no peace to the wicked: Iſai</hi> 48. 22. yea in the ſame reſpect (viz.) that there is no peace to the wicked) after much peace promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the godly, he compareth the wicked to the raging ſea, which cannot reſt, and whoſe waters doe caſt vp (as it were continually) <hi>mire and dirt: Iſai</hi> 57. 20. <hi>Salomon</hi> likewiſe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the wicked and the righteous (that is, of them that are not and of them that are the children of God, ſaith, the <hi>wicked fleeth when no man purſueth, but the righteous are bold as a lyon: Prou. 28. 1. Eliphaz ſaith that the ſound of feare is euer in the eares of the wicked: and that</hi> euen <hi>in the daies of his proſperity the deſtroier ſhall come vpon him: Iob</hi> 15. 20. <hi>Iob</hi> himſelfe likewiſe ſpeaketh thus of the wicked, <hi>terrors ſhall ouertake him as waters: &amp;c. Iob</hi> 27. 20. The wicked indeed cry to other and to their own hearts eſpecially, <hi>peace peace,</hi> as it is often in the Prophets <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 14. and 8. 11. but yet the Lord ſaith (as before we heard) that <hi>there is no peace to the wicked.</hi> Yea, how can they haue peace, <hi>that know not the way of Peace: Iſat</hi> 59. 9. and which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the Goſpell of peace: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 15. yea the <hi>Prince of peace Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe:</hi> and which alwaies are in contention wounding one another and ſowing the ſeeds of diſcord and contention amongſt men? As when <hi>Iehoram</hi> ſaid to <hi>Iehu, is it peace Iehu? Iehu</hi> anſwered, <hi>what peace whiles the whoredomes of thy mother Iezabel and her witchcrafts are yet in great number? 2. Kings</hi> 9. 22. ſo to the wicked that ſhall ſpeake of peace, or enquire after peace it may be anſwered, <hi>what peace can there be vnto them, when ſo many ſinnes as they haue committed in great number remaine vncancelled and vnpardoned in heauen, and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of in the earth?</hi> This that I ſpeake of the wicked is not only to be vnderſtood of the meaner ſort of the wicked, that are bare, poore, without friends, and worldly delights: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of Princes and other in great place, that haue great friends, that abound in wealth, that flow in delights of the world, that
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:18428:172"/> are mighty in authority, and want nothing which might ſeeme helpfull to them againſt feare, or to make for their peace and good ſecurity. And this is manifeſt by the deadly feare of <hi>Nabal, Saul, Belſhazzar,</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> before ſpoken of. If therefore the greateſt ſort of the wicked be ſubiect to ſuch feares, who notwithſtanding haue many meanes in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men to ſecure them againſt feare, what ſhall be ſaid of other?</p>
               <p>True indeed, the wicked do not alwaies feare thus, becauſe through the extreme hardneſſe of their hearts (whereunto God in great iuſtice doth giue them ouer, which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt iudgement of all other in this life) they are without fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the cauſe of this feare. Sometimes alſo when they feele this feare comming vpon them, they labour by the pleaſures of this life, or by company, or by ſome ſuch meanes, to ſhift and ſhake it off. But alas poore men, they ſtriue againſt the ſtreame: yea they haue wind and tide againſt them in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. The more they put off feare for a time, the ſtronger it will returne in the end: As a man troubled with the tooth-ake, for the mitigation thereof for the preſent taketh cold water, which maketh the paine more violent afterward: and as one that hath ſcald his leg rhruſteth the ſame preſently into cold water, and thereby findeth eaſe of the heat for a while, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward feeleth the greater and longer paine: ſo they that by paſtimes and pleaſures and worldly buſineſſe, and good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, put away their feares for a time, doe finde them more extreame in the end. It is with ſuch men as with many an ill debter, that being arreſted by ſome bay liffe or ſergeant, at the ſuit of ſome one of his creditors, to auoid impriſonment doth either violently reſiſt, or ſmiteth the bailiffe or the ſergeant on the head, that he laieth him for dead: or elſe gerteth him into a tauerne or Alehouſe, and there maketh him ſo drunk, that himſelfe eſcapeth for the preſent. But what doth he helpe himſelfe by this meanes? nothing at all: yea, he plungeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into further danger. For in the end the creditor at whoſe ſuit he was arreſted, dealeth the moreſeuerely with him.

If men be without this feare, they are ſecure and without the ſpirit of adoption: that is, they are not the children of God, as afterward vpon an other occaſion we ſhall heare againe. But as for ſlauiſh feare, ſuch as is forbidden, &amp; ſuch as ariſeth only fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> regard of Gods power &amp; iuſtice without reſpect to his mercy and goodneſſe
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:18428:174"/> and ſuch as is repugnant to faith which is the aſſurance of Gods fauour: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. this is alſo contrary to the peace of Gods children: and of this it is to be vnderſtood <hi>that they are deliuered out of the hands of their enemies that they may ſerue God without feare: Luk.</hi> 1. 74. But are the children of God indeed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies without this kind of feare, ſo that they neuer haue any brunts thereof?

Yea, ſo much the more doe they often feare (otherwiſe then they ſhould) both Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and alſo the rage and cruelty of their enemies, becauſe the vnſanctified part doth ſo oppreſſe, and ſometime and for a time, ouerwhel me the ſanctified part and the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them, that they thinke themſelues not to be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate at all, neither euer to haue receiued the ſpirit of adoption, but to be meer naturall men, and as wicked as any other. But although they doe thus feare, looking only to Gods iuſtice and not to his mercy, and reſpecting only the corruption of nature remaining in them, not the beginnings of grace, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are aſſured of an inheritance reſerued in heauen for them, as alſo of their own preſeruation here by the power of God: yet euen then haue they cauſe not to feare, but to be of good cheare in reſpect of thoſe arguments againſt feare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore handled. As the wicked do ſometimes taſte the <hi>powers of the world to come: Heb.</hi> 6. 5. that is, of the ioies of heauen, ſo the Lord will haue his children to haue a little marke of the feares that are proper only to the wicked, that they may pray the more earneſtly for recouery of their former peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

So we did ſee before, that the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſciples of Chriſt feared vpon imagination that they had ſeen a ſpirit when they ſaw him. So many of the children of God haue in all ages feared, and now doe often feare: becauſe they iudge not aright of the graces of God in themſelues, but thinke they haue no faith at all, no loue at all, &amp;c. and therefore no aſſurance at all of Gods fauor and of their owne ſaluation, becauſe their faith, loue, and other graces of God are weake and come ſhort of that they ought to be: becauſe they are able to diſtinguiſh between a nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and an imperfection of Gods gifts, accompanying ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them; therefore they thinke that to be a nullity, that is only an imperfection. It is alſo with the godly in this caſe as ſometime with a company of rebellious ſubiects, where notwithſtanding the king hath pardoned and ſent his pardon vnto them, ſigned with his owne hand, and ſealed with his own ſeale. For as ſuch hauing no skill to read their pardons, doe therefore doubt of them, and feare the kings diſpleaſure: ſo many of Gods children, being pardoned of all their ſins, and hauing their pardon written in their hearts by Gods own finger, and ſealed with the ſpirit of adoption, do notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doubt and feare, becauſe they cannot well read the ſaid pardon. But why can they not read it? either becauſe it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in ſmall letters, which their ſight being but in part, cannot ſee: or becauſe they haue not gone long enough to ſchoole for the learning to read Gods hand perfectly and readily: or
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:18428:175"/> becauſe they themſelues haue forgotten that which they had learned in that behalfe: or becauſe they haue kept their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſo rechleſly and careleſly, that the ſame being blotted and obſcured with many ſinnes (through their negligence and careleſneſſe committed,) cannot well be read by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues or any others for a time, viz. ſo long as they liue ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, and till they haue purged themſelues of ſuch ſinnes, as whereby not only the writing of their pardon is blurred, and made vnlegible: but alſo their own ſight is dimmed ſo, as they neither can read their pardons, nor ſee any thing els touching their ſalution as they ought. So had <hi>Dauid</hi> blotted and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the pardon of all his ſins and dimmed his own ſight by his ſinne with <hi>Bethſheba</hi> and againſt <hi>Vriah,</hi> that he was troubled with many feares, which made him to complaine of his ſtate as if it had been as bad as any mans, and that he praieth the Lord to create in him a new heart, as if he had neuer been regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate before: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 10. The afflictions alſo of this life befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the children of God (being eſpecially compared with the proſperity of the wicked) do ſo blind their eies, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not behold the goodneſſe of God to the peace of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as they ſhould, and as ſometime they behold the ſame. This made the Prophet to ſay, <hi>I haue clenſed my heart in vaine: Pſal.</hi> 73. 13 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yea <hi>Dauid</hi> being baniſhed from the Arke of God and in danger of many enemies, had ſuch trouble of mind and feares of heart that he was faine to rebuke himſelfe in that behalfe, and to ſay to his ſoule (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we heard) <hi>why art thou caſt down, O my ſoule? and why art thou diſquieted within me? Pſ.</hi> 42. 5. 11. &amp; 43. 5. Finally, ſomtime ſuch ſeares of the children of God, &amp; the error of their iudgement touching them, ariſe from ſome bodily cauſe, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholik co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitutio, wherby the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is ſo crazed, that it doth not erre only in matters of God, &amp; which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cern ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but alſo in things of this world &amp; which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cern this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t life.

No maruel then though the ſaid humor doe ſomtime obſcure
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:18428:175"/> the fauor of God and darken the peace of conſcience, euen in the beſt of Gods children. Theſe that are thus occupied with feares, doe meaſure their condition more by feeling then by faith and other arguments of greater certainty then feeling. But howſoeuer the children of God in theſe and the like reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects be troubled with ſuch feares for a time: yet as before we ſaid of other troubles of this life, ſo I may alſo ſay of thoſe feares, that the Lord doth at the laſt deliuer them our of all, and turne them likewiſe to their great good: yea, for the moſt part the Lord giueth his children moſt inward peace when they haue moſt outward calamities: at leaſt when they haue <note place="margin">Note.</note> moſt need of ſuch inward peace, then alſo haue the godly moſt peace, yea, moſt comfort. When the wicked are moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied, namely in the times of greateſt ſtormes and tempeſts; euen of moſt mighty and fearfull thundrings &amp; lightnings, at ſuch times the wicked quake and tremble, as fearing ſome greater euill towards them; and ſo indeed oftentimes it falls out: but contrariwiſe the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God looking not ſo much to the lightnings, nor hearkning ſo much to the thundrings, as conſidering therin the great power of God how able he is to ſaue them, &amp; how ſoon he can ſubdue their enemies, do in this reſpect both follow their callings the more quietly, and alſo hold vp their heads the more cheerfully. The like may be ſaid of them in the howre of their death: <hi>Mark</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dauid) the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man, and behold the iuſt, for the end of that man is peace: Pſal.</hi> 37, 37. and why ſo? the ſonne anſwereth the father (I meane <hi>Salomon</hi> anſwereth <hi>Dauid)</hi> ſaying, <hi>the day of death is better then the day that one is borne</hi> (that is, to the child of God) <hi>Ec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l.</hi> 7, 3. and why is this? becauſe the day of death to the children of God is the day of deliuerance from all their miſery. The children of God themſelues die not, but their miſery then dieth: yea, then alſo their ſinne the cauſe of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and chiefe miſery it ſelfe, maketh an end. Secondly, death to the godlie, is but a ſhort bridge, and a ſpeedie paſſage to eternall life: they take not onely their leaue of all calamities, but they enter <hi>alſo into their Maſters ioie, and take now more full poſſesſion,</hi> then euer before they had of that moſte bleſſed inheritance, whereof
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:18428:176"/> before they heard, and which they had a long time moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly longed for. On the contrary howſoeuer the wicked for a time, eſpecially in proſperity, ſeem to be at peace and ſo liue ſecurely fearing nothing, yet if aduerſity once come, then they rage and ſtorme: then they fret and chafe: then they raile and raue: then they curſe and ſweare: then they ſpeake not only againſt men but alſo againſt God himſelfe: eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the day of their death is moſt fearfull vnto them, as being the end of all their happineſſe, and the beginnings of their greateſt woe and miſery: and ſo they finiſh their daies moſt heauily, moſt fearfully: yea ſometime they are ſo diſcontent with ſome things befallen vnto them, or ſo tormented in their minds with feare of Gods iudgements againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they play the bloody butchers vpon themſelues. So <hi>Achitophel</hi> in malcontent mind hanged himſelfe: 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 23. ſo <hi>Iudas</hi> (as before we heard) in great deſperation of Gods mercy did make the like fearfull end of himſelfe: <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 5. That ſometime the children of God die vnquietly in outward appearance, it is to admoniſh other the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelues for their end, and to labour the more to trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vp for themſelues comfort (by keeping a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) for the day of their death. That the wicked die ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time peaceably and in ſhew comfortably, either it is to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all men not raſhly to iudge, ſith God can in a moment ſecretly worke repentance: or elſe howſoeuer ſome will ſay of ſuch, that they went away like a bird, or died like a lamb, yet rather if they ſhewed no repentance, eſpecially if they did not indeed repent, they are to be thought to haue died like beaſts, that for the moſt part, dying naturally of ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and not being killed violently, doe only pant and grone, and make no other noiſe: As it is ſaid of <hi>Nabal,</hi> that when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigail</hi> had related what <hi>Dauid</hi> had purpoſed againſt him, and what ſhe had done to ſaue <hi>Nabal</hi> from the execution thereof, that <hi>his heart died wit hin him, and he became like a ſtone and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten daies after he died:</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 22. 28. ſo the wicked dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ſins and yet not dying raging nor rauing, &amp;c. doe die like ſtocks or ſtones, that is, neither ſhewing any more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, neither any whit more regarding any goodneſſe
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:18428:176"/> then ſtocks or ſtones. But to returne to the children of God, ſuch is their peace vpon the grounds before mentioned, that as they are freed from the ſeruile feare of Gods wrath and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſo they are likewiſe freed from all ſuch feare of other creatures as whereby they ſhould be diſmaied or diſabled from ſuch duties as belong vnto them. For what need they feare any thing, ſith God hath made a league with all creatures in their behalfe? and ſith <hi>they know that all things doe worke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for their good,</hi> as before we haue heard? we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Note.</note> conclude they need not <hi>to feare any euill tydings: Pſal.</hi> 112. 7. yea though <hi>they walke through the vale of the ſhadow of death: Pſal.</hi> 23. 4. but that euery one of them may ſay, <hi>the Lord is my light and ſaluation, whom ſhall I feare?</hi> the Lord is the <hi>ſtrength of my life of whom ſhall I be afraid? Pſal.</hi> 27. 1. and againe, <hi>I will lay me downe and alſo ſleep in peace, for thou Lord makeſt me dwell in ſafety: Pſal.</hi> 4. 8. this peace of the children of God is not only common to them all, neither only proper to them alone, neither only alwaies in them euen in all troubles and in death it ſelfe (in manner notwithſtanding and with the excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before expreſſed) but it is alſo accompanied with great ioy of the holy ghoſt, and ſuch as none of the wicked doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy though they be kings and Princes, or otherwiſe aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in all proſperity. Indeed commonly the ſtate of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God is accounted the moſt lumpiſh, dumpiſh, heauy, and ſolitary ſtate of all other. Yea, amongſt many other things that do diſcourage men from being the children of God, this is not the leaſt, that they thinke there is no ioy, no mirth, no gladneſſe belonging to them, but that if once men will frame themſelues to be the children of God, then they muſt bid fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to all ioy, and they muſt prepare themſelues to all ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and heauineſſe. But this is a foule and groſſe error, euen proceeding from the father of lies. For the truth is, that as the righteous and none but the righteous are often bid <hi>be glad and reioice: Pſal.</hi> 32. 11. and 33. 1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4 4. and elſewhere; ſo indeed in reſpect of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and of the fauour of God, and of all other benefits before mentioned, they haue more cauſe to be glad and reioice then all the world beſides. Yea, none but they haue ſound cauſe to be glad, and reioice:
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:18428:177"/> For ioy and peace are as well as accounted fruits of the ſpirit, as loue, patience, goodneſſe, faith, gentleneſſe, and temperance: <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. and the kingdome of heauen is as well ſaid to be in peace and ioy in the holy ghoſt, as in righteouſneſſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. in both which places this is to be obſerued that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie ioines peace and ioy together as I now doe, euen as the cauſe &amp; the effect: it is therefore euident, that there is no ſound ioy but where there is <hi>the ſpirit and kingdome of God.</hi> The Lord ſpeaking of the wicked and of the godly ſaith thus, <hi>Behold my ſeruants ſhall reioice and ye ſhall be aſtonted: behold my ſeruants ſhall ſing for ioy of heart, and ye ſhall cry for ſorrow of heart, and ſhall howle for vexation of mind: Iſai</hi> 65. 13. 14.

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:18428:177"/> that he was ſo far from being aſhamed of his croſſes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold troubles, that he did rather reioice and glory in them, and ſo we ſee indeed, that he and <hi>Stlas</hi> being in priſon, did not mourne and weep, but ſang Pſalmes euen at midnight: <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 25. The like ioy we read to haue been, if not in all, yet diuers of the martyrs mentioned in the book of the Acts and Monuments. Yea the truth is, that in reſpect of the premiſes the meaneſt child of God that hath faith and regeneration but as a grain of muſtard ſeed, hath more ſound and true mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of reioicing (euen in afflictions) then the greateſt, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt and the mightieſt monarch in all the world, that hath not receiued the ſpirit of adoption. Yea, how can they reioice that haue no communion with Chriſt, that are dead in their ſinnes, that are no better then fooles and madmen, that are in bondage vnto ſins, yea, vnto ſatan himſelfe, that haue no free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in heauen, neither any trade for any merchandiſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whoſe ſins doe all remaine in the book of Gods account, and that may continually feare when God will enter into iudgement with them, that haue no liberty to come to God, once to aske pardon of the ſaid ſinnes, becauſe they haue not faith wherein they ſhould offer vp their praiers, and without which all their praiers are abominable vnto God: that haue no benefit by the word of God, either for their direction, or for their comfort, or for their defence againſt the enemies of their ſaluation, &amp; that therefore are alwaies naked and lie open to all their aſſaults, &amp; that much leſſe haue any thing to do with the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which are ſeales of Gods word: that haue no right or intereſt in any bleſſings of this life, but ſhall giue an account of euery thing they haue had &amp; vſed, as vſurpers, &amp; as thieues, againſt whom all things work together for their euill, proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and aduerſity, friends and foes: their good deeds which they ſeem to haue done as well as their apparant euill deeds: that are excluded out of the kingdome of heauen and are in the ſtate of condemnation, euen ſo long as they continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpirit of adoption: condemned already: what ioy, I ſay, can any haue that are in ſuch a caſe, though they be neuer ſo great, neuer ſo rich, and neuer ſo mighty monarchs in the world? Verily as they ſhall (if they repent not) bee throwne into vtter darkneſſe <hi>where ſhall bee weeping and</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:18428:178"/> gnaſhing of teeth, and where they ſhall be tormented for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore with the diuell and his Angels: ſo if they know their wofull and miſerable condition, they haue cauſe to mourne and to houle continually in this life: yea, more cauſe ſo to doe, then the pooreſt man in the world good or bad: becauſe the more God doth aduance them in this world, the greater ſhall their damnation bee in the world to come, if in this life they do not glorifie God according to their ſaid adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cement. Sith that the children of God haue ſuch ioy and peace, as that no afflictions doe or can expreſſe the ſame, how great is their dignity in that behalfe? Their ioy I grant, may be and ſometime is eclipſed and obſcured for a time, by the ſame meanes whereby it is ſo with their peace: for ſuch as any mans peace is, ſuch is his ioy: but as the ſunne being ſomtime eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the interpoſition of the moone betwixt vs and it, and more often darkned by thicke and blacke clouds, doth not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding break out againe and ſhine as bright as before: ſo it is with the children of God. Their ioy is ſometime obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and hidden, not onely from others, but alſo from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. But <hi>though they weep for a time, yet their ſorrow ſhall bee turned into ioy, and their heart ſhall reioice</hi> (for the moſt part in this, and moſt certainly in the life to come) and their <hi>ioy ſhal no man take from them: Ioh.</hi> 16. 20. 21. As the wicked ſhall mourne, and no man ſhall be able to comfort them (as before we haue ſeen by the examples of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Indas)</hi> ſo ſhall the children of God reioice, and no man ſhall take their ioy from them. Though ſometime they lie <hi>among pots</hi> (or ſtones, and by many afflictions be as it were coloured) yet <hi>they ſhall bee as the wings of a Doue that is couered with ſiluer, and whoſe fethers are like yellow gold: Pſal.</hi> 68. 13. <hi>they ſhall haue beauty for aſhes, the oyle of ioy of mourning: the garment of gladneſſe, for the ſpirit of heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Iſai</hi> 61. 3. yea euen in their heauineſſe their ioy from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue is greater then their mourning here below. As <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon found hony and the hony combe in the carkaſſe of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring lyon: ſo the children of God find moſt ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort euen in the very belly and bowels of thoſe afflictions which deuoure the wicked: The riddle of <hi>Sampſon</hi> touching the foreſaid hony <hi>(out of the eater came meat, and out of the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:18428:178"/> ſtrong came ſweetneſſe)</hi> was inexplicable to the Philiſtims till they had ploughed with Sampſons heyfer: Iudg.</hi> 14. 14. ſo indeed that the children of God are cheerfull and comfortable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen full of ioy and gladneſſe in their pouerty, reproch, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſuch other like aduerſity, ſeemeth a thing very ſtrange to the vngodly, and no man can explicat or expound the ſame, but only the children of God, and they that haue <hi>ploughed with their heyfer,</hi> that is, with the ſame ſpirit of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, wherewith they and they only are indued. For they only haue that <hi>white ſtone</hi> (ſpoken of before) <hi>wherein is a new name written, which no man knoweth but he that receiueth it: Reu.</hi> 2. 17. And how great the peace and the ioy of the children of God is, and how truly it may be ſaid to paſſe al vnderſtanding, and to be <hi>vnſpeakable and glorious</hi> (as before we heard it to be called) doth not only appeare by the feare and griefe of the wicked, but alſo by the like afflictions, trouble, and heauineſſe of mind ſometimes in the godly, when God, for the reaſons (before ſpoken of) hideth his face from them. For that which is ſaid generally of all creatures, may particularly be ſaid of them: <hi>if thou hide thy face they are troubled: Pſal.</hi> 104. 29. By this trouble (I ſay) of the godly themſelues, when ſometimes for a time they haue loſt their former ioy and peace, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, how great their ſaid peace and ioy is, and how worthie of that commendation, which before we haue heard to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto it. For aske one of them that haue for a ſeaſon loſt their former peace and ioy, and that troubled in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, yea aske the very wicked themſelues, which feele the terrors of an euill conſcience, and feares of Gods wrath, aske (I ſay) either the one or the other, what they would giue for a releaſe from their troubles and feares, and for comfort, and they will crie out with teares, that if they had a thouſand worlds, they would giue all for true peace and ioy. Conſider how the Church mourneth for neglect of her belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueds voice, yea how her heart fainted in that behalfe, and how ſhe charged the daughters of Ieruſalem, that if they did find her welbeloued, they ſhould tell him that <hi>ſhe was ſicke of loue for him: Cantic.</hi> 5. 6. how <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo was troubled, when he
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:18428:179"/> wanted that peace and ioy which before he had, we haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewed. Touching the ioy of the wicked which ſeemeth to be very great: firſt the truth is, that it is a painted and pictured ioy, without any ground: yea without any ſubſtance: it is only in face and countenance, and (as weſay) from the teeth: it is not from the heart: it is but as the laughter of phrenſie and madneſſe in the pangs of death. Secondly, it is therefore very ſhort and vncertain: as it is ſaid of the laughter <hi>of a fools, that it is like the cracking of thornes vnder a pot: Eccl.</hi> 7. 8. though it make a great blaze &amp; a loud noiſe for a time, yet on a ſudden it vaniſheth and commeth to nothing. Thirdly (which is more then the former) the more the wicked laugh and are merry here, the more they ſhall weep and mourne and houle in the world to come. As the ſtrongeſt wine makes the ſharpeſt vineger, euen ſuch as will fetch off the skin from the rough of ones mouth; ſo the greater ſhall be their calamity, and their greater ioy ſhalbe turned into the greater heauineſſe. But becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things before written, of the proſperity of the wicked, may likewiſe bee referred to that point of their ioy which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from no other cauſe then from their proſperity, therfore I will here ceaſe to write any more thereof.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point of the ioy and peace of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, as they haue better cauſe of peace and ioy then all the wicked in the world (though kings and Princes) ſo their peace and ioy cannot but be much greater, how poore, baſe and miſerable ſoeuer they ſeem to be in the world, and are indeed touching their outward ſtate. They may reioice when the wicked (euen Princes) may mourn: they may laugh, when ſuch may weep: they may ſing, when the others for all their wealth, pleaſures, friends, power and authority, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, may cry and houle. As the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was ſaluted in this manner, <hi>baile Mary</hi> (or <hi>reioice Mary) thou art freely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Lord is with thee, &amp;c.</hi> and againe, <hi>feare not, for thou haſt found fauour with God, for thou ſhalt conceiue in thy womb &amp; beare a ſon, and call his name Ieſus: Luk.</hi> 1. 28. 29. 30. and as the Angell ſaid to the ſhepheards, <hi>bee not afraide, behold I bring yon

Here let vs vnderſtand, firſt that they hurt no body, but ſuffer euery one with whom they doe liue, or with whom they haue any dealings, to liue in peace, and quietly to enioy their owne. Secondly, that they are many waies helpfull, and do much good vnto other.
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:18428:181"/> The firſt is no ſmall matter if we conſider how harmfull the wicked are continually vnto all, with whom they dwell, as to ſome by their prophaneneſſe and impiety, either animating them to the like, or diſcouraging them from the contrary: ſo alſo to other by their vnreuerend behauiour towards their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, by their pride and violence againſt their inferiors, by their contempt of their equals, by their cruelty and vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in word and deed, by their vnchaſt ſpeech, geſture, and other actions: by vniuſt dealings touching the goods of their neighbors, and by their backbitings, ſlandering, and falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing, and otherwiſe defaming of them. They that haue daily experience or haue heard of theſe things, would thinke it a great benefit to liue where they might be without feare of ſuch dammage. And that this is a benefit and ſo to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, appeareth by the words of <hi>Nabals</hi> ſeruants to <hi>Abigail</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>Nabal</hi> had ſo wickedly and churliſhly ſent away the meſſengers of <hi>Dauid</hi> empty. For they doe amplifie the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and wicked anſwer of <hi>Nabal</hi> to <hi>Dauids</hi> meſſengers, as by ſome kindneſſe of <hi>Dauid</hi> towards them in the wilderneſſe, ſo alſo by pleading that they had no diſpleaſure, neither had miſſed any thing ſo long as they were conuerſant with them, when they were in the fields: 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25 15. But are theſe things all? No verily: but as themſelues do no hurt to other, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are great meanes to keep other from doing that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill againſt God, againſt their neighbors and againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which otherwiſe they would commit: for who ſeeth not that the wicked conuerſing daily with the godly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſpecially in their company do refrain from many ſinnes, many othes, many blaſphemies, many curſes, from much vaine talke, filthy ſpeech, &amp; much fooliſh ieſting, from other outrages alſo which they would freely commit if they were by themſelues alone. Many times alſo the Lord keepeth the reprobate themſelues from ſome hainous ſinnes for the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ſake, which otherwiſe they would greedily commit. Did not God keep <hi>Abimelech</hi> king of <hi>Gerar,</hi> from defiling <hi>Sara</hi> for <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſake? <hi>Gen.</hi> 206. and may not the like be ſaid of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other? Doubtleſſe this is partly the meaning of that which is written of <hi>Herods feare and reuerencing of Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> that
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:18428:182"/> is, of the fearing to commit ſome euils for his ſake, from which otherwiſe he would not haue refrained: <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 20. So that <hi>Eſau</hi> hoped of the death of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and then purpoſed to haue killed <hi>Iacob,</hi> what doth it elſe import, but that in the meane time he feared the committing of that fearefull mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſake? <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 41. But not to ſtand vpon this, let vs come to the good they doe to other.</p>
               <p>Heere at the firſt let it be conſidered, that as God made the woman firſt to be an helpe to the man, ſo by this firſt combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of man and wife there is exceeding benefit of the one by the other, where both parties ioined together are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Lord. For there the husband loueth the wife e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as Chriſt loueth his Church, accounting her as <hi>fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone;</hi> cleauing only vnto her, protecting her from all wrong, inſtructing her where ſhe is ignorant tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching her ſaluation, increaſing the knowledge which ſhee hath, bearing with her in her weakneſſe, prouoking her to all good duties belonging to her ſex and calling. So the wife re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerencing the husband, is in all things in the Lord ſubiect vnto him, and ordered by him; gouerning the things wiſely that are committed to her charge, for the good of her family; not onely bringing foorth children as the Lord bleſſeth the mariage bed vnto them; but much alſo helping her husband in the Chriſtian education of them in the feare of the Lord. So <hi>Bethſheba</hi> helped <hi>Dauid</hi> in the inſtructing of <hi>Salomon: Pro.</hi> 31. 1. <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe being imploied in the publike affaires of the kingdome. So <hi>Lois</hi> the grandmother, and <hi>Eunice</hi> the mother of <hi>Timotheus,</hi> were great helpes (or rather more then helpes, doing all themſelues alone) for the inſtructing of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi> in the Scripture from his childhood. Furthermore, the Chriſtian wife is an helpe to her husband, by ouerſeeing the waies of her ſeruants, and ſeeing them to doe their worke early and late. Both ſuch parties alſo are comfortable one to another, in proſperitie reioicing together, in aduerſity mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together; and ſo bearing one anothers burdens, that betwixt both it is the lighter. This mutuall helpe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that the man and wife, being both the children of God, haue one by another, is more apparent by the great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance

Yea though but one of the parents be the childe of God, and the other none of Gods children, yet the children of two ſuch ſo vnequally yoked, are within the Couenant by vertue of that party which is the childe of God: <hi>1.

As the children of ſuch parents as are themſelues the children of God, haue theſe benefits by their ſuch parents, ſo likewiſe great is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and comfort that ſuch parents haue by their children, that walke in the couenant of God: viz. by their feare of God, by their obedience to them, and their praiers for them, and by their good behauiours towards all other: in which reſpect <hi>Salomon</hi> doth often commend ſuch children, in the book of the Prouerbs: <hi>A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father: Prou.</hi> 10. 1. and 15. 20. <hi>My ſonne if thou be wiſe mine heart ſhall reioice, and I alſo: Pro.</hi> 23. 15. and againe, <hi>the father of the righteous ſhall reioice: he that begetteth a wiſe ſonne ſhall haue ioy of heart: thy father and thy mother ſhall be glad, and ſhe that bare thee ſhall reioice:</hi> verſe 24 25. <hi>My ſonne be wiſe and reioice mine heart, that I may anſwer him that reprooueth me: Pro.</hi> 27. 11. and 29. 3. ſometime alſo it commeth to paſſe that good children become parents to their parents, by releeuing them in their neceſſities, and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them in their outward ſtate: ſo <hi>Ioſeph</hi> is ſaid to haue <hi>nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed his father Iacob, and all the reſt of his ſonnes, and their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: Gen.</hi> 45. 18. and 47. 12. ſo likewiſe <hi>Ruth</hi> was a great helpe

Daily experience alſo teacheth, that the godly haue great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their beaſts, both for their worke, taking no more of them then they are able to do, neither laying greater burdens vpon them then they are able to beare: and alſo keeping them, and giuing them meat accordingly.

The Lord ſheweth how odious this is, by opening <hi>Balaams</hi> aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:18428:189"/> to him againe. If thou ſeeſt thine enemies Aſſe lying vnder his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, wilt thou ceaſe to helpe him?</hi> (as if he ſhould haue ſaid, wilt thou be ſo hard hearted and vnmercifull?) <hi>thou ſhalt helpe him vp againe: Exod.</hi> 23. 4. As this is commanded, ſo the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are ready to performe it. In reſpect of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that other creatures thus haue by the children of God, as alſo in reſpect of the bondage wherein they are by the ſinne of man vnto vanitie, whereunto they are ſubiect, we may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well thinke, that if ſuch creatures had knowledge, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and iudgement, to diſcerne twixt the children of God, and the wicked, they would vtterly renounce all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the wicked, and wholly and only with all willingneſſe and cheerefulneſſe ſubmit themſelues vnto the children of God. Thus much for the benefits that inferiour creatures (I meane the creatures of this nether world) doe receiue by them that are ſealed with the ſpirit of adoption, and therefore are regenerated and borne againe to be ſonnes and daughters of God. But is this all? Not ſo: wee may yet take one ſteppe further. And as before we deſcended from man to other baſe creatures heere below, ſo we may now from both thoſe kinds aſcend vnto the very heauens, that is, to principalities and powers in the heauenly places. Touching theſe therefore, it is firſt ſaid by the Apoſtle, that this was one ſpeciall end of his miniſterie, and of the miniſterie of the Goſpell of others, viz. <hi>to make cleere vnto all men what the fellowſhip of the myſterie is which from the beginning of the world had beene hid in God.</hi> Wherefore vnto all men? That ſo vnto <hi>principalities and powers in heauenly places might be made knowen by the Church the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold wiſdome of God. Epheſ.</hi> 3. 9. 10. By this place we plainly ſee, that the Angels haue the benefit of more knowledge then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had. Of the fellowſhip of the foreſaid myſterie, and that by the Church. What is the Church but the companie of Gods children? This is the more manifeſt by that that there is ſaid of that myſterie, <hi>to haue beene before hidden in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and not ſo to haue beene opened to the ſonnes of men in other ages, as now it is:</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>and to haue beene kept ſecret ſince the world began: Rom.</hi> 16. 25. For doe not theſe phraſes intimate, that the ſaid myſterie had beene hidden ſo in God himſelfe
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:18428:189"/> from the beginning of the world, that the very Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues did not fully vnderſtand it till it was made knowen by the Church? The ſame is to bee thought of many myſteries contained in the Reuelation, becauſe it is ſaid of the booke in the right hand of him that ſate vpon the throne written within, and on the backe ſide, ſealed with many ſeales (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Chapters in the Reuelation following ſeeme eſpecially to be vnderſtood) becauſe (I ſay) it is ſaid of that booke, <hi>that none in heauen, nor in earth, nor vnder the earth, was able to open the booke, or to looke thereon, but only the Lion of the tribe of Iuda,</hi> that is, Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>Reu.</hi> 5. 2. This Lion of the tribe of <hi>Iuda</hi> doth not only vnderſtand the ſame booke himſelfe, but alſo by his ſpirit maketh it knowen to the Church, by whom alſo the Angels (attending thereupon in all aſſemblies thereof) ſeeme likewiſe to come to know it, and not by any immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate reuelation thereof vnto them in heauen, neither (as ſome doe weakly imagine) by contemplation of God himſelfe, in whom all things, paſt, preſent, and to come, are as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen. For ſo they ſhould know the ſecrets of mens hearts, and the day of iudgement, which none knowes but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For are not all thoſe things ingrauen in God as well as others? I grant the Angels to know much more of their owne nature, and of the nature of God himſelfe, then the Church knoweth, yea then perhaps is reuealed in the written word: yet this letteth not, but that the Angels may bee ignorant of the meaning of ſome things contained in the word, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Gods pleaſure towards the Church, till the ſame by the ſpirit of Chriſt be reuealed to the Church. I will not ſo inlarge this point in this place as Iſee it handled in ſome late printed bookes: but I will content my ſelfe with this thus generally ſpoken thereof.</p>
               <p>Another benefit of the Angels by the children of God is, that they haue great iov of their conuerſion and repentance. This our Sauiour teacheth plainly by a double parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 3. &amp;c. one of the loſt ſheepe, the other of the loſt groat, for the finding whereof there was great ioy: the application of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th which parables is thus made by our Sauiour hin ſelfe: <hi>I ſay vnto you, that likewiſe ioy ſhall bee in heauen ouer one ſinner
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:18428:190"/> that repenteth, &amp;c.</hi> and againe, <hi>I ſay vnto you, there is ioy in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Angels of God for one ſinner that conuerteth:</hi> 7. and 10. And indeed there is a great reaſon of this their ioy: for doe men reicice in earth for the birth of a ſinner? and ſhall not the Angels in heauen reioice for the regeneration of a chriſtian? Doe men reioice for the birth of one of Gods enemies? and ſhall not the Angels reioice for the birth of one of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Doe the true ſubjects of an earthly prince reioice and declare their ioy by ſome teſtimony, at the birth of a child to ſuch an earthly Prince? how much more ſhould the Angels in heauen (Gods perfecteſt ſubjects) reioice at the birth of a child to God himſelfe, the king of heauen and earth? euen of one that ſhall it ſelfe be, and is as ſoone as it is borne, not only a Prieſt but alſo a king, as before we heard? Is there ioy in earth for the birth of one that ſhall die againe, and perhaps a miſerable death? how then ſhould the Angels not reioice in the birth of one, that ſhall neuer die more: but ſhall liue for euer: a life of grace here till the time of tranſlation from hence do come, and then a life of glory with themſelves: yea, with Chriſt Ieſus? Did the Angels reioice when Chriſt was borne a man vpon earth? and ſhall they not reioice when men are borne partaker of the diuine nature from heauen and for heauen? yea wherefore did the Angels ſo reioice at the birth of Chriſt? was it not becauſe by his birth in the world many ſhould afterward be borne vnto God? As ſoone as euer Chriſt had taken the book before ſpoken of, out of the hands of his Father, to open the ſame to the Church, how did the Angels reioice and ſing for ioy, as wel as the 24. Elders? <hi>Reu.</hi> 5. 8. 9. Did they ſo reioice at the taking of the book to be opened to the Church? how much more cauſe haue they to reioice and ſing when by the opening of myſteries in the ſame book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, men ſhall be enlightned with true ſauing knowledge of God, and of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, and be alſo new borne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vnto God? As the Angels doe thus reioice in the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of the children of God, that is, when men firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be the children of God: ſo it is not to be doubted, but that their ioy is increaſed, as ſuch graces are increaſed in men, whereby they are the more declared both to men and Angels
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:18428:190"/> to be ſo regenerated, and new borne vnto God. I might am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie this point much more: but hauing been large in other things, it ſhall be ſufficient thus briefly to haue ſpoken of this matter. So we ſee what great benefits, both men, and other creatures, the inferior creatures of this inferior world, and the ſuperior creatures, euen the bleſſed Angels in heauen haue by the children of God. Is not this therefore a great increaſe of their dignity? Is it not an high commendation of their ſtate and condition? That the wicked are hurtfull to all, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to none, doth make their eſtate the more baſe and vile, abiect, and contemptible. Therefore that the children of God are hurtfull to none, and ſo beneficiall and helpfull to many, it muſt needs make their condition more honorable and noble.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O omit diuers other arguments whereby the dignity of Gods children might bee furthered, enlarged and illuſtrated, let vs now come to certaine compariſons. Herein I will a little tranſgreſſe the order of Logicians (as I haue not hitherto been curious therein) and therefore I will begin with ſome ſimilitudes, whereby the holy ghoſt in reſpect of ſome things before handled, doth ſet forth the excellency of the children of God. From theſe ſimilitudes I will proceed to other compariſons. Touching ſimilitudes, the book of the Canticles is moſt plentifull in this behalfe. For whatſoeuer by ſimilitudes is ſpoken generally in commendation of the Church, doth belong to all the children of God, as members of the Church. As therefore in reſpect of the excellent graces of God before handled (as it were the matter wherein ſtands the eſſence of the children of God) we heard the children of God to be compared to a <hi>Doue, whoſe wings are couered with ſiluer</hi> (that is, ſeem to be) and <hi>whoſe feathers are as yellow gold: Pſal.</hi> 68. 13. ſo alſo to the whole Church Chriſt ſpeaketh thus: <hi>My loue behold thou art faire: behold thou art faire thine eies are like the Doues: Cant.</hi> 1. 14. In the next Chapter the Church
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:18428:191"/> ſpeaketh thus of her ſelfe: <hi>I am the roſe of the field</hi> (or rather the roſe that groweth in ſunſhine places, that is moſt odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) <hi>and the lilie of the vallies:</hi> verſe I. and in the next verſe Chriſt applauding and approuing the former ſimilitude ſaith, <hi>like the ltlie among the thornes, ſo is my loue among the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> in which compariſon Chriſt plainly compareth the wicked; that are aduerſaries to Gods Church, vnto thornes, good (in a manner) for nothing, but for the fire, and ſuch as will continually pricke and otherwiſe annoy the children of God. Where this is to be obſerued, that the Church her ſelfe <note place="margin">Note.</note> ſpeaketh not thus of the wicked, but that Chriſt calls them by the names of thornes, to teach the Church and euery member thereof, to be ſparing in iudging and cenſuring their aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (how hurtfull ſoeuer) and to leaue iudging and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of them to Chriſt. But to returne to that former ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of lilies, it is there and often afterward in the ſame book vſed to magnifie the ſtate of Gods children as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other, as the lily of the open field (alwaies hauing the benefit of the ſunne) is more beautifull then all other flowers: and this ſimilitude is the more to be regarded, becauſe our ſauiour ſpeaking of the ſame ſaith, that <hi>Salomon</hi> in all his roialty was not clothed like one of them: <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 29. yet was <hi>Salomon</hi> the moſt glorious king that euer was in the world. Our Sauiour therefore teacheth the ſtate of Gods children (being like to the lilies) to be more honorable then all the ſtate of moſt glorious earthly kings. In the next Chapter our Sauiour againe compateth his Church to a moſt <hi>ſtraight piller of ſmoke ariſing from the moſt rich and pleaſant compoſition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, that can be deu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the 4. Chapter, verſe 1 Chriſt doth not only (as before he had done, compare the eies of the Church to the eies of a Doue, but ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th alſo <hi>that her lockes were within,</hi> (not hanging out like the locks of harlots) and <hi>that her haire was like a flocke of goats which looks downe from the mountaines of Gtlead:</hi> that is, that all their outward behauiour was moſt comely to behold, as a flock of well fed goats kept in good order: Secondly, he
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:18428:191"/> addeth, ver. 3. that <hi>her teeth were like a flock of ſheep in good order, which go up from the waſhing: whereof euery one brings forth twins, and none is barren among them:</hi> that is, whoſe Miniſters of the word (which do as it were chew the cud for the ſouls of other) are all (touching principall points of doctrine and other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour) in good order, agreeing one with another, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foorth fruit moſt plentifully, to the great increaſe both of the number of ſoules in the Church, and alſo of all good workes in euery particular member thereof. Yea hee addeth moreouer, verſe 3. that <hi>her lips are like the threed of ſcarlet, and her talke comely:</hi> (that is, all her ſpeech was gracious) and that <hi>her temples were within her lockes as a peece of a pomegranat:</hi> that is, that her countenance was moſt modeſt and baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as if ſhe bluſhed, and were red cheeked, like a pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. In the 4. verſe he proceedeth to other compariſons, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>her necke was as the tower of Dauid, built for defenſe, and that a thouſand ſhields hang therin, and all the targets of ſtrong men:</hi> whereby he ſignifies, that ſuch as were to beare and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine her gouernment, were all like to <hi>Dauids</hi> Tower, well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with all armour of proofe, and ſuch as were manifeſt arguments of moſt glorious victories. In the fifth verfe hee ſaith yet more, that <hi>her two breſts were as two yoong kids that are twinnes feeding among the lilies:</hi> whereby he ſignifieth, that all her doctine being onely taken out of the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth moſt ſweetly agree together, without any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, like two twinnes: and is moſt ſincere milke, wherewith as with moſt dainty and tender kids fleſh, fed in moſt pleaſant paſtures, full of all pleaſant and amiable flowers (ſuch as were lilies amongſt them, and cowſ lips and peagles are in the beſt of our paſture grounds) ſhe nouriſheth both her ſelfe, and all the children that God doth giue vnto her. In the 8 verſe, and the reſt following, hee calleth her by the name of his ſpouſe, (as before we heard) and ſo ſignifieth, that ſhe is as deare and precious vnto him, as any wife or new maried ſpouſe is to any husband. In the 9. verſe alſo he compareth her to his ſiſter, in reſpect that ſhe is to be an inheritrix together with him of his Fathers Kingdome. Yea he doth compare her to a ſiſter <hi>ſo beautifull, and deckt with chaines</hi> and other ornaments of
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:18428:192"/> Gods ſpirit, that hee confeſſeth himſelfe to bee wounded and rauiſhed with the loue of her. In the 10. verſe hee amplifieth that her loue in reſpect of thoſe graces by other compariſons, <hi>preferring the ſame before wine, and the ſauour of all other ſpices,</hi> becauſe as ſome being wounded, and with their wounds ſain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, are reuiued by wine, and comforted by ſweet odours; ſo he being before as it were wounded with her loue, was againe reuiued and comforted with her graces. In the 11. verſe hee compareth her lips (that is, her gracious words proceeding out of her lips) vnto <hi>the ſweet droppings of the hony combe, yea to hony mixt with milke, as being</hi> not only pleaſant, but alſo <hi>nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable,</hi> as before we heard <hi>the lips of the righteous to feed many: Pro.</hi> 10. 21. In the ſame verſe alſo hee compareth her good workes (neuer ſeparated from her gracious ſpeech) vnto the ſauour of garments ſmelling as ſweet (that is, being as accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table) as the ſweet wood of <hi>Lebanon</hi> is to men, as the Angell teſtifieth <hi>Cornelius</hi> his praiers and almes to haue beene vnto God: <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 4. In the 12. verſe, for the better expreſſing of hisloue, calling her againe by the name of <hi>his ſister and ſpouſe,</hi> hee ſetteth her foorth by three other ſimilitudes, ſaying that ſhe is <hi>as a garden encloſed, as a ſpring ſhut up, and as a fountaine ſealed up:</hi> by all which he commendeth both her ſafety from all enemies, and from all corruption and put<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>efaction of the world; and alſo her preſeruation and reſeruation for the only vſe of himſelfe, and of all other whom he will haue refreſhed with her liuing waters. In the 13. and 14. verſes he compareth her workes againe, or all the race and poſteritie of her (ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by plants) for profit, beauty, and pleaſantneſſe, to an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard of <hi>pomegranats, with ſweet fruits, as cipres, ſpikenard, ſaffron, calamus, and cinamon, with all the trees of incenſe, myrrh, and aloes, with all the chiefe ſpices:</hi> then hee concludeth in the 15. verſe his whole commendation of her in that place with the ſimilitudes or metaphors before vſed, ſaying by way of exclamation, <hi>Ofountaine of the garden! O well of liuing waters, and the ſprings of Lebanon!</hi> nothing thereby, that there is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing water to bee had, but by communion with the Church, to whom alone Chriſt giueth the water of eternall life, whereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hoſoeuer drinketh ſhall neuer thirſt any more. In the fifth
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:18428:192"/> Chapter there is little of the Church, but only ſome titles or metaphors repeated that before we heard of. The reſt of that Chapter is moſt diuine deſcription of Chriſt himſelfe by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers metaphors ſutable to theſe, whereby before Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had deſcribed the Church. In Chap. 6. ver. 3. Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth the Church by 3. attributes, euery one illuſtrated by a ſimilitude, ſaying, that by the grace of God, and in reſpect of the ſpirituall gifts that God had beſtowed on her, <hi>ſhee was beautifull as Tirzah</hi> (that had beene a goodly city in the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where before <hi>Samaria</hi> was built, <hi>Ieroboams</hi> chiefe kingly palace ſeemeth to haue beene, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 14. 7.) <hi>comely as Ieruſalem, called the perfection of beauty, and the ioy of the whole earth, Lament.</hi> 2. 15. and terrible <hi>as an army with banners,</hi> viz. by her excellent diſcipline, and by the maieſtie of him that dwelleth in her, and protecteth her. In the verſes following ſome former ſimilitudes being repeated, in the 9 verſe, beſides the laſt former ſimilitude, in the end of the ſaid verſe, he ſetteth her foorth by 3. other ſimilitudes, viz <hi>looking forth as the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> (that is, moſt gloriouſly) <hi>faire as the moone</hi> (euen at the full, and in a cleere night) <hi>and pure as the ſunne,</hi> that is, without all mixture, and not hauing ſome parts thicker then ſome other, (as the moone ſeemeth to haue) but being all and euery part alike and the ſame: as the Apoſtle vſing a word taken from the ſunne, would haue the <hi>Philippians</hi> to be, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 10. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth chapter Chriſt ſeeing the Church comming (as it were a far off) congratulateth her comming with a ſpeech of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſaying: <hi>How beautifull are thy going with ſhooes O Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces daughter!</hi> ſo he compareth her to the daughter of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and deſcribeth her parts from the feet vpward, by moſt excellent ſimilitudes, telling all poſterity, that her feet were moſt ſoundly and ſafely ſhod (as it were) with <hi>the preparation of the Goſpell of peace, and her hippes or thighs compaſſed with Iewels, the worke of cunning workemen</hi> (or made moſt artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that is, girded with the girdle of truth: verſ. 1. or elſe by the Iewels of the thighs or hippes, he meaneth ſome ſpeciall ornament in thoſe times, worne vpon that part, thereby ſignifying the virtue of chaſtitie: and this the rather ſeemeth to bee the meaning, then the other, becauſe if from the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:18428:193"/> ſhooes we ſhall aſcend to the middle, and then deſcend backe againe in the verſe following to the nauill, there might ſeem to be ſome diſorder not well agreeing to ſo elegant a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then from the hips or thighs, he aſcendeth higher to the nauill, ſaying thereof, <hi>that it is as a round cup wanting no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor: and of her belly, that it is as a heap of wheat compaſſed about with lilies:</hi> verſe 2. meaning by that ſimilitude of the nauell, that ſhe had not a barren womb, but was already ſo fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerued, that her fruit ſhould be as a great quantity of wheat, growing out of a moſt ſweet ſoile, as that is which beareth lilies: from the nauell and the belly, he commeth to the breaſts, ſhewing them to be <hi>as two yong kids that are twins:</hi> 1. full of dainty food for the nouriſhment of the ſeed, wherewith before he had ſaid ſhe was conceiued. From the two breaſts he commeth to the neck, comparing the ſame to a <hi>Tower of Iuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:</hi> thereby ſignifying the authority of the Church, for the ſtrength and whiteneſſe or beauty thereof, to be like vnto I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uory, and for the height thereof to be like to a tower: after the neck, he compareth her eies to <hi>artificiall pooles in the frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted gate:</hi> that is, in the kings gate, which was the chiefe way to the threefold towne of Ieruſalem: and wherein likewiſe was a great market of cattell, and the poole of <hi>Betheſdas,</hi> that had fiue porches: by this ſimilitude noting the miniſters of the word, which are the eies of the Church, to be moſt cleere and quickſighted, for the better enlightning of the cics of other, and therefore greatly frequented and reſorted vnto, as ſome common thorow-fare, highway, or great market: verſe 3. he deſcribeth alſo her noſe by the likeneſſe <hi>of the tower of Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, looking towards Damaſcus:</hi> by this ſimilitude reaching the Church to be of exquiſite iudgement for the diſcerning of all doctrines and ſpirits of men, and other things that differ: verſe 4 Laſt, verſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. he ſetteth forth <hi>her head to be as skar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let. and the buſh of her head like purple, ſo that the king is tied in her beames:</hi> thereby ſignifying the attire of her head to be ſo gracefull and excellent, that no king can behold the ſame, but he will be greatly in loue thereof: or that he himſelfe Chriſt Ieſus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s ſo enamored of her, upon the ſight of her beautifull attire, that he is willingly tied (as it were) to be preſent perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:18428:193"/> in her holy congregations. By all this elegant and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent deſcription of the Church in each part thereof, Chriſt Ieſus would haue all to know her to be ſo glorious, as that no earthly thing is to be compared thereunto. Therefore after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the 7. verſe (as if he thought no words ſufficient to ſet foorth her excellencie) he ſaith further, that <hi>her ſtature was like a palm: tree, and her breſts like the cluſters:</hi> ſo that he meaneth, that ſhe is tall and ſtraight, flouriſhing the more, the more by perſecution ſhee is preſſed downe: and alſo that the old and new Teſtaments, her two breſts (as before we heard) are neuer drie, but alwaies full of liquor, and moſt precious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable doctrine, like to the blood of grapes. In the 8. verſe, beſides ſome former ſimilitudes, he compareth the ſauour of the Churches noſe to bee like vnto apples: by this meaning, that her breath that commeth out of her noſtrils is moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delectable. In the 9. verſe he proceedeth, ſaying, that <hi>the roofe of her mouth is like good wine, which goeth ſtraight vp to her welbe loued, cauſing the lips of him that is aſleepe to ſpeake:</hi> by this ſimilitude ſignifying, that the word of God in the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Church, and deliuered by her miniſtery, is like to wine, that ſparkleth vpward, and which worketh ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully (being the word of life) that euen the dead hearing the voice of God therein are awakened, and haue their mouthes opened to ſpeake to his praiſe. Theſe be the chiefe ſimilitudes whereby <hi>Salomon</hi> in that moſt excellent ſong, called therefore <hi>The Song of Songs,</hi> that is, the moſt excellent of all ſongs; whereby (I ſay) <hi>Salomon</hi> in that moſt diuine ſong generally ſetteth foorth the excellencie of the whole Church, and the which may bee applied to euery particular member of the ſame. In reſpect therefore of theſe ſimilitudes, wee may well conclude againe the ſtate of all the children of God to bee the more excellent.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, let vs alſo briefly conſider of ſome other ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes whereby in other reſpects the dignitie of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is likewiſe ſet foorth vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore let vs call to minde the excellent ſpeech of that wicked man <hi>Balaam,</hi> which notwithſtanding hee ſpake not of himſelfe, but by the holy Ghoſt, and wherein he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecieth
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:18428:194"/> moſt diuinely of the ſtate of the Iſraelites, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them moſt elegantly in one ſentence to diuers things: <hi>As the vallies</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>are they ſtretched out, as the gardens by the riuers, as the Aloe trees which the Lord bath planted: as the Cedars beſides the waters: Num.</hi> 24. 6. That which he ſpeaketh of the children of Iſrael, may much more be ſpoken of all the true Iſrael of God, euen of all that by regeneration and adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are ſuch children of God as now we ſpeake of. Secondly, let that alſo bee remembred that is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 3. where the children of God by other properties deſcribed in the two firſt verſes, the Prophet ſaith further, that <hi>they ſhall be like trees plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the riuers of water, which doe bring foorth their fruit in due ſeaſon: whoſe leafe ſhall not fade.</hi> The application of which ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude he maketh in the next words, ſaying, <hi>Se whatſoeuer he doth, ſhall proſper;</hi> then hee addeth a contrary ſimilitude of the wicked, ſaying: <hi>the wicked are not ſo: but as the chaffe which the winde driueth away, verſe</hi> 4. The Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> hath the like in a manner of both, I meane both of the children of God, and alſo of the wicked. But firſt of the wicked, then of the children of God: for hauing ſet downe this generall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the wicked, <hi>Curſed is the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arme, and withdraweth his heart from the Lord,</hi> (ſo doe all the wicked) then hee proueth the ſame by a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: <hi>for he ſhall bee like the heath in the wildernes, and ſhall not ſee when any good commeth: but ſhall inhabit the parched places in the wildernes, in a ſalt land and not inhabited.</hi> Chap. 17. 5. 6. In the very next verſes hee addeth the contrary of the children of God, ſaying: <hi>bleſſed is the man that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is</hi> (ſuch are the children of God) for hee ſhall be <hi>as a tree that is planted by the waters, which ſpreadeth out her roote by the riuer, and ſhall not feele when the heate commeth: but her leafe ſhalbe green, and ſhal not care for the yeare of drought, neither ſhall ceaſe from yeelding fruit.</hi> In the Pſalme 92. 12. the Prophet commendeth the righteous by theſe ſimilitudes, <hi>the righteous ſhall flouriſh like a palme tree, and grow like a cedar in Lebanon, ſuch as bee planted in the houſe of the Lord ſhall flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the courts of our God, they ſhall bring forth fruit in their age, they ſhall bee far and flouriſhing.</hi> But of the wicked it is ſaid, <hi>the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:18428:194"/> wicked ſhall periſh, and the enemies of the Lord ſhall bee conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as the fat of Lambes, euen with the ſmoke they ſhall be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: Pſalm.</hi> 37. 20. We haue heard likewiſe before other ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes in reſpect of the certaine eſtate of Gods children, viz. that they are ſaid to bee like <hi>to mount Sion, and like to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem compaſſed about with mighty mountaines: Pſal</hi> 125. 1. 2. and <hi>like a houſe built vpon a rocke, againſt which no ſtormes can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile:</hi> whereas on the contrary, the wicked (though hearing the word but not doing it) are compared <hi>to a houſe built vpon the ſand, which when ſtormes and tempeſts came, was ouerthrowne: Mat.</hi> 7. 24. With theſe let vs remember the compariſon before mentioned, of the children of God, vnto a <hi>thing hallowed to the Lord, and vnto his firſt fruits: Ierem.</hi> 2. 3. The Prophet <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie</hi> compareth the people of God to the <hi>Apple of Gods eie: Zach.</hi> 2. 8. By both theſe ſimilitudes the holy Ghoſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that as things in the law conſecrated to God, as the firſt fruits, and other things, were pretious vnto God, and as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man accounteth highly of the apple of his eie, and is very tender thereof; ſo all the children of God are very pretious to God, and he is very tender of them. Doe not all theſe ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes much ſet foorth the excellent ſtate and condition of Gods children? There are many other the like ſimilitudes, but hauing giuen this taſt of theſe, I will leaue the reſt to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as he ſhall meet with them in the ſcripture. To come to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compariſons, if it were a great honor to the Iſraelites to be called the people of God, yea ſuch an honor as that in that reſpect, they were more excellent then all other nations, how great a thing then is it now for them that at that time were no ſuch people of God, to be called the ſonnes of the liuing God? <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Paul</hi> often calleth himſelfe the ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt, the ſonne of God, as reioicing in that name, and thinking the ſame more honourable, then if hee had beene heire of all the monarches of the world. And indeed what ſeruice of anie King, or of all Kings, is comparable to the ſeruice of God, King of kings are able to giue ſuch rewards for their ſeruice, as there is in keeping of Gods commandements? <hi>Pſalme</hi> 19. 11.
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:18428:195"/> If it bee ſuch an honour to bee the ſeruant of the Sonne of God, is it not much more to bee the ſonne or daughter of God himſelfe? Let no man here obiect, that the difference is not great, becauſe they that are ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt, are alſo the children of God. For though this were ſo in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular example of <hi>Paul,</hi> yet it is not ſo in the generall: all are not the children of God, that are the ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt, or of God himſelfe. <hi>Iudas</hi> was a ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt, as well as the reſt of the Apoſtles. <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> is called the ſeruant of God: <hi>Ierem</hi> 27. 6. yet neither of them both were the ſonnes of God by adoption, ſuch as we doe now ſpeake of.</p>
               <p>It is a great honour to bee called the friend of God, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> is called: <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 23. as likewiſe for <hi>Lazarus</hi> to be called by Chriſt himſelfe, his friend, and the friend of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: <hi>Iohn</hi> 11 11 and for the diſciples of Chriſt to be called his friends: <hi>Iohn</hi> 15 15. how great then is this dignity to be taken into ſo neere a familiarity with God, as by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be called, and to be made indeed his children: yea ſuch children, as are made one with his owne and only natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſonne? To proceed yet further, although the ſtate of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> in their firſt creation, being made in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God himſelfe, hauing the ſoueraignty ouer all other inferior creatures, and being placed in the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> were verie excellent, yet the ſtate of the meaneſt of Gods children by adoption in Chriſt is farre more excellent, more honourable. For the firſt ſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> was not ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but that it was mutable, and was indeed changed, in as much as hee loſt that excellent ſtate, wherein a the firſt hee was created. But touching the ſtate of Gods children by adoption in Chriſt, wee heard before that it is ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that it cannot be altered: euery name written in the booke of life, ſhall ſo remaine written, and ſhall neuer bee blotted out. Whom God hath once bleſſed as to makethem his children, they ſhall bee bleſſed for euer. <hi>Adam</hi> had the grace of perſiſting, in the fauour of God, and in his firſt ſtate if hee would. But euery child of God by adoption, hath
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:18428:195"/> the grace of willing to perſiſt, and the moſt conſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, with many other aſſurances (before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) that hee ſhall perſiſt, and neuer wholly and finallie fall away. The firſt honour and prerogatiue of <hi>Adam</hi> was, that hee had power not to ſinne. The honour and prerogatiue of Gods children now by adoption is much more, viz. that they haue not power to ſinne: <hi>whoſoeuer is thus borne of God, ſinneth not, neithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Iohn</hi> 3. 9 Chriſt himſelfe as he was man, was (and is) more excellent then <hi>Adam,</hi> before his fall, becauſe the manhood of Chriſt was perſonally vnited to the Godhead: There was no ſuch communion betwixt God and <hi>Adam.</hi> As Chriſt was thus more excellent then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſo his obedience could not but bee more excellent then the obedience of <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity: therefore alſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the reward of Chriſts obedience was likewiſe more excellent. This reward being not for himſelfe, but for them whom the Father giueth him, and who were predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to be adopted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>refore it followeth that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of all that are adopted in Chriſt Ieſus, is and ſhall bee better then the reward of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould haue been, if he had ſtood in his firſt perfection: becauſe the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is made theirs. The preſent eſtate indeed of <hi>Adam</hi> was better, then the preſent ſtate of Gods children here. But the future ſtate of Gods children by adoption is far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the reaſon before mentioned, then the future ſtate of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould haue beene, though hee had neuer fallen. Yea, touching the preſent ſtate alſo of the one and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe <hi>Adams</hi> ſtare ſhould alwaies haue been vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and the hope of Gods children by adoption is moſt certaine, ſo that whoſoeuer is once by adoption made the child of God, ſhall neuer bee deiected from the ſame ſtate: therefore alſo in reſpect of this certaintie, the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of adoption is greater to euerie one adopted, then the prerogatiue of Creation was at the firſt vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is one thing to haue an helpe, without which a thing
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:18428:196"/> is not done, and another thing to haue helpe, wherby a thing is done. Vnto the firſt man being made ſo right, that he had power not to haue ſinned, not to haue died, not to haue loſt his excellency, there was giuen an helpe of perſeuerance: not whereby he did perſeuere: but without which by his free will he would not haue perſeuered: but now to the children of God by adoption, there is not onely giuen ſuch an helpe of perſeuerance, that they may perſeuere if they will; but alſo ſuch, as whereby they haue perſeuerance it ſelfe: that is, not only that without this gift they cannot perſeuere, but alſo ſuch, as whereby they cannot but perſeuere. For Chriſt hath not only ſaid, <hi>without mee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To proceed yet further, doth not our Sauiour himſelfe preferre them that doe his Fathers will which is in heauen (who are they but the children of God by adoption in Chriſt?) before <hi>his mother and his brethren</hi> according to the fleſh? <hi>Matth. Matth.</hi> 12. 48 49. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 27. What ſhall I ſay more? or what other compariſon ſhall I make? Truly I may generally conclude this point of Gods children, in compariſon of all other men, with that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſentence of <hi>Salomon,</hi> before ſpoken in the title page, that <hi>the righteous is more excellent then his neighbour: Prou.</hi> 12. 26. From thoſe compariſons of the children of God with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, I may now aſcend into heauen it ſelfe, and compare them with the holy, and bleſſed, and glorious Angels: and that firſt in ſome ſort as equall fellowes and companions: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, being in ſome reſpect more excellent and honorable then ſuch Angels. The firſt is acknowledged by the Angels themſelues: for when <hi>Iohn</hi> falling downe before the Angell which had bidden him to write, <hi>Bleſſed are they which are called to the Lambes Supper,</hi> would haue worſhipped him, he forbade him ſo to doe, ſaying, <hi>See thou doe it not: I am thy fellow ſeruant, and one of thy brethren: Reu.</hi> 19. 10. and 22. 9. Touching the ſecond, the Angels are not onely fellow ſeruants vnto God with the children of God but they are alſo themſelues ſeruants vnto the children of God: for it is expreſly ſaid, that <hi>they are miniſtring ſpirits, ſent out for their ſakes which ſhall bee heires of ſaluation. Heb.</hi> 1. 14. Who are ſuch heires of ſaluation but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the children of God? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. It is alſo written in the Pſalme: <hi>The Angell of the Lord pitcheth round about them that feare him, and deliuereth them: Pſalm.</hi> 34. 7. The ſame is
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:18428:197"/> curdent by examples of the Angels in ſcripture attending vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diuers particular perſons: vpon <hi>Abraham, Iacob, Moſes, Ioſhua, Gedeon, Dauid, Daniel, Mary, Ioſeph, Peter, Cornelius, Paul, &amp;c)</hi> yea not only attending vpon them, but alſo deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them out of their dangers, in flicting the iudgements of God vpon their aduerſaries, and otherwiſe helping and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting them according to their neceſſities. This is the more, becauſe it is neuer ſaid, that the children of God are ſeruants to the Angels. Yea, when the children of God haue offered their ſeruice to the Angels, at leaſt to worſhip them, they haue refuſed and forbidden it, as before we heard. Neither doe the Angels attend vpon the children of God whiles they liue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but alſo when they die; viz. to carry their ſoules into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 22. But this perhaps may ſeem no good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the prerogatiues of the children of God, aboue the Angels, becauſe ſometime a Prince may honor an inferior ſubiect, with the attendance of a more honorable perſon, and with ſome ſeruice to be done vnto him, by ſuch a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable perſon then himſelfe: and becauſe alſo the Angels being mightier, may ſeem therather to gard and otherwiſe to attend vpon the children vpon earth in reſpect of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold infirmities and weakneſſes, as alſo becauſe of their great aduerſaries, &amp; not for any ſuch dignity of the children of God vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth as we haue ſpoken of. Though I ſhould gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t all this, and not contend of the preferment of Gods children aboue the Angels in that reſpect: yet this I may boldly (I thinke) vtter, that there ſeemeth to be a great preheminence of the children of God, in reſpect that there is a more neere coniunction betwixt Chriſt and them, then there is betwixt Chriſt and the Angels. I meane in nature, not in place. In place, the Angels for the preſent, are neerer to Chriſt then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God in earth; but in nature the children of God are neerer to Chriſt then the Angels. For it is expreſly ſaid that <hi>Chriſt tooke not the nature of Angels vnto him,</hi> and it is plaintly affirmed that he tooke on him the ſeed of <hi>Abraham: Heb.</hi> 2 16. and that <hi>he was made of the ſeed of Dauid: Rom.</hi> 1. 3. as alſo it is ſaid, that he took our nature vpon him in reſpect of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in the womb of the virgin: ſo by contracting and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:18428:197"/> marrying himſelfe vnto vs, and and vs vnto himſelfe, he hath made (as we heard) a further vnion with vs, whereby it is ſaid of vs in reſpect of him, that <hi>we are fleſh of his fleſh.</hi> So then by conception and incarnation, he is made one with vs: and by the former contract of marriage, we are made one with him. Firſt he is fleſh <hi>of our fleſh, and bone of our bone,</hi> and ſecondly, we <note place="margin">Note.</note> are fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone: this latter ſpeech cannot be ſpoken properly, but by vertue of his marriage and contract with vs: for otherwiſe he is rather fleſh of our fleſh (touching his humanity) then we fleſh of his fleſh. Becauſe we in that reſpect were before him. The former cannot truly be ſaid to be of the latter: but the latter may well be ſaid, to be of the former. According alſo to that before ſpoken by vertue of the ſaid marriage contract of Chriſt with vs, we are ſaid to be members of Chriſt, or of the body of Chriſt with vs, we are ſaid to be members of Chriſt, or of the body of Chriſt. To apply all this, is the like euer ſaid of the Angels that they are members of Chriſt? yea how can they be ſaid to be his members, being altogither of a diuers nature from him? for muſt not the head and the members be both of one nature? or will not the whole that hath a head of one nature, and the body of another, be a kind of monſter? I grant, that Chriſt improperly and by a kind of metaphor may be called the head of the angels, in reſpect that (euen as mediator) the angels <hi>and powers, and mights, are ſubiect vnto him:</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 22. but that he is the head of the angels in ſuch ſort as he is the head of elect men, adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the children of God, it cannot be, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be his members as we are. In reſpect therefore that we are more neerly vnited vnto Chriſt then the angels (firſt by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his conception, ſecondly by his mariage contract with vs) why may I not ſay, that we haue a kind of preheminence aboue the angels? for as euery thing is more vile the further off it is from that which is moſt excellent: ſo euery thing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be the more excellent, the neerer it is to the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. Moreouer we haue before heard, that the great names and titles of Chriſt are communicated to the children of God. Can the like be ſhewed of the Angels? As therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had in Scripture ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>thou art my ſonne, this day haue I begotten thee,</hi> and neuer ſo ſaid of the Angels,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:18428:198"/> the Apoſtle maketh this concluſion. that Chriſt was made ſo much <hi>more excellent then the Angels, by how much hee had obtained a more excellent name then they: Hebr.</hi> 1. 4. ſo why may not I make the like conciulion from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that the children of God are made ſo much more excellent then the Angels, by how much they haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained more excellent names then they? The names of Seraphims, principalities, powers, and mights, &amp;c. are great names: but are they like to the names before mentioned: eſpecially may they be compared to the name Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Againe, for as much as wee haue before heard, that the regeneration or new birth, or ſecond creation of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, is a greater and more excellent worke then the firſt creation of all things; and ſith the Angels haue their part onely in the firſt creation; why may not this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bee thought to bee ſome prerogatiue of the children of God aboue the Angels? Laſt of all Chriſt promiſeth, that the children <hi>of God ſhall ſit with him in his throne, as himſelfe ſitteth in the throne of his Father,</hi> and that <hi>by them hee will iudge the world, yea the Angels</hi> that are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len. Hath hee promiſed any ſuch thing to the Angels that doe ſtand? or hath hee ſaide anie ſuch thing of them? they are indeed ſaid to ſtand before him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his throne, &amp;c. but they are neuer ſaid to ſit in his throne. To ſtand before him, and round about his throne, importeth onely ſeruice: But to ſit, and that in his throne, importeth authoritie and maieſty. But ſome man againſt all before ſpoken, of the preeminence of the children of GOD in earth, aboue the Angels in heauen, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps obiect, that our Sauiour ſpeaking of the ſtate of Gods children in the world to come, doth ſet it foorth by their ſimilitude to the Angels in heauen, ſaying, <hi>when they ſhall riſe againe from the dead, they are as the Angels of God in heauen: Matth.</hi> 22. 30. If in the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ſhall bee but like to the Angels, how can they here be ſaid to haue any preeminence aboue them? To this I
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:18428:198"/> anſwer, that it is but a ſleight and weake obiection: for our Sauiour doth not ſimply ſay, that in <hi>the reſurrection the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God ſhall be like the Angels:</hi> but onely that as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mariage (where of the queſtion was propounded by the Sadduces) they ſhall be like, and therefore he ſaith, <hi>In the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, they neither marrie wiues, nor wines are beſtowed in marriage, but they are as the Angels of God in heauen.</hi> So then this compariſon of likes is not in all things, but only as touching marriage: and this is more manifeſt by that which followeth in the ſecond verſe of this preſent text, where we read (and ſhall afterward by Gods grace heare) that at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of Chriſt we ſhall not only bee like to the Angels, but alſo to Chriſt himſelfe, which is likewiſe more then euer we read of the Angels.</p>
               <p>Now though I haue hither to thus written of their preeminence of the children of God, aboue the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in reſpect of their communion with Chriſt, and by vertue thereof, yet we muſt neuer forget, that as there is that preeminence, ſo alſo in ſome other reſpects, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (for the preſent time eſpecially) haue great prerogatiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the children of God. Namely, firſt that they dwell in heauen; the children of GOD in earth: Secondly, that they are altogether ſpirit; the children of God fleſh and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Thirdly, they are free from all ſinne, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie from all miſerie, the fruit of ſinne; the children of God, whiles they are clothed with corruption, are ſubiect to ſinne, and doe ſinne daily; and by ſinne, they are alſo ſubiect as to many other calamities, ſo at laſt to death it ſelfe. So in theſe reſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cts they are inferior to Angels: but in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer they haue a great prerogatiue. What a dignitie is this? what an honour? what a glorie, to all the children of God, to be ſo aduanced? was it not a great honor for <hi>Daniel,</hi> to be one of the three rulers, that were by <hi>Daniel,</hi> to be one of the three rulers, that were by <hi>Darius</hi> ſet ouer all the one hundred and twenty gouernors, whom hee had before ſet ouer all his whole kingdome? How greate then is the honour of all the children of GOD, in that they haue a preeininence aboue Angels, who in reſpect of other creatures vnder GOD, are principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:18428:199"/> powers, mights, and dominions? What was <hi>Darius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? yea, what was great King <hi>Salomon,</hi> in all his earthlie pompe, in all his honor, in all his roialtie and glory, in reſpect of the leaſt Angell?</p>
               <p>If any man, notwithſtanding all before written of this point, touching the preeminence of the children of God aboue An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſhal differ in iudgement, let him vnanſwerably and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie (without cauilling) anſwer my former reaſons, and ſhew better for his iudgement, and I will eaſily change my former opinion. I affect not any noueltie: I am not delighted with ſingularitie: neither am I ſo peremptorie in any thing that I hold (differing from other the true ſeruants of God) but that I am ready in al humilitie to ſubmit my ſpirit to the Prophets, which ſhall ſpeake according to the ancient holy Prophets and Apoſtles. In the meane time, let not this point be thought a curious or vnneceſſarie paradox: but let it rather be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as a point of great vſe, to prouoke vs to more thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto God, and to be ſo much more zealous of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, by how much the more he hath aduanced vs: and finally, the more to comfort vs, and the better to aſſure vs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Gods fauour towards vs, the more highly he hath exalted vs.</p>

For heereby it doth the more manifeſtly appeare in what price and reckoning they are with God.</p>
               <p>Touching the promiſes and threatnings of God in behalfe
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:18428:199"/> of his children, they are firſt of all ioined together. For, when God firſt made a ſpeciall couenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, this is one ſpeciall article (as before vpon other occaſion wee haue heard) of the ſaid couenant, that <hi>God would bleſſe them that should bleſſe him, and curſe them that ſhould curſe him: Gen.</hi> 12. 3. Was this promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> as one man? Not ſo: but as he was the root and father of the faithfull. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the faithfull children of God haue right to the ſaid promiſe: and it doth belong to euery one of them as well as it did to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe: ſo that whoſoeuer ſhall bleſſe or doe any good to any of <hi>Abrahams</hi> children by faith, hee may as well looke for a bleſſing from God, as any that bleſsed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> or did any good to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe: and whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall curſe or doe any hurt to any of <hi>Abrahams</hi> children by faith, he may as well feare a curſe from God, as any that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did curſe or doe any hurt to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Touching promiſes in particular, <hi>If hee bee bleſſed</hi> (that is, vnder many bleſſings) <hi>which</hi> generally <hi>iudgeth wiſely of the poore, Pſal</hi> 41. 1. and that generally likewiſe <hi>is mercifull, becauſe he ſhall obtaine mercy, Matt.</hi> 5. 7. then much more bleſsed, and much more may they hope for mercy, that iudge wiſely of the godly, and that ſhew mercy to the children of God.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Prophet praieth (or exhorteth to pray) that <hi>they may prosper that loue Ieruſalem, Pſal.</hi> 122. 6. by <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> there meaning, not only the publike ſtate of the Church, but euery particular member thereof, becauſe it cannot goe well with the whole, except it goe alſo well with euery member. Now although that bee a praier, or exhortation to praier, yet the matter thereof inſinuateth a promiſe: for neither the Church, nor any part thereof, may pray for any thing in their owne behalfe, or in behalfe of any other, whereof they haue no promiſe. Foraſmuch therefore as the Church praieth (or exhorteth to pray) for them <hi>that loue Ieruſalem,</hi> viz. that ſuch may proſper; it followeth, that there was and is a promiſe of the proſperitie of all thoſe that loue <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> (that is, of the Church, and whole compaine of Gods children) and euerie part thereof, that is, of euery one of Gods children therein, or thereunto belonging. Our Sauiour ſpeaketh yet more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

(ſo condemning them, not to haue helped the Lord, that did not helpe his people) how much more doth the curſe of God belong to them that go out to hurt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, or that doe any thing for the damnifying of them? When the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> had ſaid, that <hi>Iſrael was as a thing hallowed vnto the Lord, and his firſt fruits;</hi> preſently hee addeth, <hi>All they that eat it ſhall offend: euill ſhall come vpon them, ſaith the Lord: Ier</hi> 2. 3. By eating there, the Prophet meaneth the offring of any indignity vnto them. For in the time of the Law, when things according to the Law were conſecrated vnto God, what common perſon ſoeuer (not of the ſtocke of the Prieſts) did eat of them, they did greatly ſinne againſt the Lord, and prouoked his heauy indignation againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. When the Prophet <hi>Zecbariah</hi> had ſaid, <hi>He that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you, toucheth the apple of his ete;</hi> immediately he addeth this commination againſt ſuch perſons, ſaving, <hi>For behold I will life vp mine hand vpon them, and they ſhall be a ſpoile to thoſe that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> ſaith againſt the rich men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that dealt hardly with the poore, <hi>buying them for ſiluer, and for old ſhoes, ſelling vnto them the refuſe of the wheat,</hi> &amp;c. (as many rich men doe in theſe daies) the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> (I ſay) ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus againſt ſuch: <hi>The Lord hath ſworne by the excellencie of
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:18428:200"/> Iaacob, Surely I will neuer forget any of their workes: Amos</hi> 8. 6. Did the Lord with an oath ſo threaten them that dealt hardly with the poore of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who long before were fallen away from God? What then (doe we thinke) threatneth he againſt all thoſe that any waies deale hardly with them whom in his abundant mercy he hath begotten againe vnto himſelfe, and whom ſo begotten he loueth with an euerlaſting loue, and wil neuer caſt them off?</p>
               <p>When <hi>Amalek</hi> came out to fight againſt the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> as they came out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and were trauelling by the wilderneſſe towards the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Lord ſpake thus vnto <hi>Moſes: Write this</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>for a remembrance in the booke, and rehearſe it vnto Ioſhua</hi> (who was to ſucceed <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and in his ſtead to fight the Lords battles againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Iſrael) for I will vtterly put out the remembrance of Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek from vnder heauen. Alſo hee ſaid, The Lord hath ſworne that hee will haue warre with Amalek. from generation to generation: Exod</hi> 17. 14. and 16. Though this were ſpoken and threatned particularly againſt the <hi>Amalckits,</hi> yet it inſinuateth a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall commination againſt all the like enemies of the children of God.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point of Gods promiſes to them that ſhew kindneſſe to his children, and of his threatnings againſt thoſe that doe ſhew them any vnkindneſſe: to conclude (I ſay) this point, as I beganne the ſame: viz. with a ſentence comprehending both; ſo let vs remember that our Sauiour applieth the parable of the vnrighteous Iudge, and of the poore widow, in this manner: <hi>Heare what the vnrighteous Iudge ſaith; Now ſhall not God auenge his elect, which cry day and night vnto him; yea, though hee ſuffer long for them? I tell you, hee will auenge them quickly: Luke</hi> 18. 6. 7. This word, to <hi>auenge,</hi> ſeemeth to import, not onely a promiſe of deliuering the elect from all their wrongs, but alſo a threatning of a iudgement againſt them that had wronged them.</p>
               <p>All this of Gods promiſes to the friends of his children, and <note place="margin">Note.</note> of his threatnings againſt their enemies, is much more to bee vnderſtood of all good towards them that are any furtherers
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:18428:201"/> of their ſaluation, and of all euill againſt them that doe any wates oppugne and hinder their ſaid ſaluation. Therefore as ſuch loue to the Saints is reckoned vp as a thing <hi>accompanying ſaluation, Heb</hi> 6 9. 10. ſo alſo to hate and perſecute the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God is ſet downe as <hi>a token of perdition: Phil.</hi> 1. 28.</p>
               <p>The more excellent alſo the perſon of the children of God is to whom any kindneſſe is ſhewed, the greater promiſe is made vnto him that ſheweth ſuch kindneſſe. Therefore in the place before alleged, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10. 41 it is ſaid, that <hi>He that reces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a Prophet in the name of a Prothet, ſhall receiue a Prophess reward.</hi> The ſame is to bee vnderſtood of threatnings: The more excellent the perſon is that receiueth any wrong, the more is threatned to him that doth the wrong.</p>
               <p>Thus much of theſe promiſes and threatnings. Touching the performance of them, the Scripture affoordeth vs many examples to witneſſe the ſame.</p>

What was the mercie of the <hi>Kenits,</hi> but the fore ſaid counſell of <hi>Iethro</hi> their father? Behold therfore a worthy example of iuſtice in a moſt vniuſt man, not to bee ſo ouercome with ſurie againſt ſome whom God himſelfe will haue to bee deſtroied, as to forget kindneſſe towards them that haue not offended, but are rather (in reſpect of themſelues or of their anceſtours) worthie of kindneſſe. A comfortable preſident alſo for all the children of God, to teath them not deſpaire, but to know that the Lord can make them that are of themſelues moſt cruell, to ſhew them mercie in their diſtreſſe. Finally, a moſt excellent ſpurre likewiſe to quicken and prouoke al men to be the more ready to ſhew fauour vnto the children of God, ſith the ſame may be remembred euen by ſuch to their poſterity long after when themſelues ſhall be dead and rotten: yea not onely to prouoke them to do good to them that haue done any good for themſelues, but alſo to thoſe that haue done good to their predeceſſours and forefathers, yea to the poſteritie of ſuch as by whom their forefathers haue receiued any benefit. All this was the more in <hi>Saul,</hi> not onely becauſe he was ſuch an one as he was, but alſo becauſe we read not of any ſuch expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement for the ſhewing of that kindneſſe to the <hi>Kenits,</hi> as
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:18428:202"/> before <hi>Saul</hi> had receiued for ſeuerity againſt the <hi>Amalekites:</hi> where therefore we may further obſerue from that which is in the ſame chapter recorded of <hi>Sauls</hi> ſhewing fauor to the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekits</hi> (contrary to Gods commandement) that the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly God forbiddeth vs any thing, the more ready we are to doe that which he ſo forbiddeth.</p>

Though they perhapsſee no benefit for the preſent, but rather may ſeeme to impaire their outward ſtate, yet in the end they ſhall find that, in reſpect whereof they ſhall thinke wharſoeuer coſt they haue beſtowed vpon the children of God, to be the beſt beſtowed money that euer they laid out in all their liues.

               <p>Laſt of all, the more any king rewardeth any kindneſſe done to any of his children, or puniſheth any indignitie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vnto them, the more hee ſheweth himſelfe to regard ſuch as haue receiued ſuch kindneſſe, or met with ſuch indignity: and the more hee doth grace and honour them before his people, that ſee his rewards vpon ſuch as haue ſhewed that kindneſſe, or that heare of his ſeuerity againſt ſuch as haue offred that indignitie.

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T remaineth now, according to my order before inſinuated in the beginning of the fourth Chapt. that I ſhew the vſe of all the doctrine hitherto handled concerning the dignity of Gods children. Theſe I will only touch, and (as it were) but point at with the finger, leauing the further inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of them to the better conſideration of the reader, as alſo of ſuch as ſhall haue occaſion more to apply and preſſe them then it is fit for me to doe in this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>Theſevſes are generally of two ſorts: viz. either common to all, euen to the wicked as well as to the children of God: or ſpeciall, either to the wicked alone, or to the godly alone.</p>
               <p>Touching common vſes, this doctrine firſt of all ſerueth to correct the baſe opinion that moſt men haue conceiued of the children of God, and to teach vs to thinke and eſteeme of them according to thoſe things before ſpoken.</p>
               <p>All men (for the moſt part) regard men more according to their ſtate in the world, that is, according to their riches, to their honour and credit with great men in the world, to their power and authority for doing of worldly matters: All men (I ſay) for the moſt part doe more regard men according to theſe things, then according to their adoption, according to their graces, whereby they ſhew foorth their adoption, and according to that eſtimation in which the ſaid graces accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying adoption, doe declare them to be with God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Neither is this the fault onely of naturall men (ſuch as are not the children of God themſelues) but euen ſometimes of
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:18428:205"/> them that are themſelues regenerated, and ſealed with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of adoption: euen they (I ſay) doe not ſo regard one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as they ought to doe in reſpect of their adoption: yea the children of God doe often times thinke the more baſely of themſelues, and are the more deiected in their owne hearts, becauſe they are ſo little regarded by other.</p>
               <p>But ſith wee haue heard before how honourable their ſtate and condition is, and how God hath moſt highly dignified and aduanced them, why ſhould they not be ſo regarded of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Why ſhould they not ſo eſteeme of themſelues? Not any whit to puffe themſelues vp, and to make themſelues to ſet vp their briſtles (as it were) with contempt againſt any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but rather to comfort themſelues the more againſt ſuch contempt, diſgrace, and indignity as they meet with in the world at the hands of other?</p>
               <p>This vſe the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> commendeth, when hee exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>not to haue the faith of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt in reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> or to eſteeme of men according to their ccſtly apparell, or outward countenance which they did beare in the world; but according to their riches of faith, and according to their in heritance <hi>in the kingdome which God hath promiſed to them that loue him: Iames</hi> 2. 1. &amp;c. Vnder this opinion I comprehend alſo loue of the heart, and honour of the outward man, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſaid opinion.</p>
               <p>For ſo much <hi>Iames</hi> ſignifieth in the plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this <hi>Iames</hi> wrote not to heathen men, nor to meere naturals, but to them whom God <hi>of his owne will had
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:18428:205"/> begotten with the word of truth, to bee as the firſt fruits of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> chap. 1. 18. thereby ſhewing, that it is a fault not onely amongſt the men of the world, too lightly both in their iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in their affections, and alſo in their outward carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to regard the children of God; but alſo in them that are of the ſame father, and haue the ſame in hert ance.</p>
               <p>And this indeed in theſe daies is a fault not onely amongſt prophane men, that contemne all goodneſſe; nor amongſt Papiſts, and profeſſed Atheiſts: but alſo amongſt profeſſors themſelues, euen of the beſt ſort: viz. too much to eſteeme the gay men of the world, and ſuch as are gentlemen borne, and haue good eſtates in the world, though they bee neuer ſo wicked and vngodly, and deſpiſers of all grace: and too baſely to eſteeme, and too little to regard the moſt apparant children of God, knowen to bee vertuous, and ſhewing many tokens that <hi>they are turned from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan vnto God, and haue receiued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We ſee alſo, whom the King createth Earle, or Baron, or maketh a Knight, all other, good and bad, high and low, call him by names agreeable, and doe otherwiſe honour him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Shall the King of Kings then honour men with the title and dignity of his children? and ſhal not men eſteeme and reſpect them in like maner?</p>
               <p>This vſe is neceſſary ſpecially in iudgement. For in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſpecially appeareth the contrary corruption: men for the moſt part preuailing moſt in their ſuits, that can ſet the beſt face vpon their matters, and that can moſt braue &amp; flaunt it out by their apparell, riches, friends, and countenance in the world: and they that haue none of theſe, but are poore, yet rich in the graces of adoption, going to the wall, and being vtterly put downe, how good, how honeſt, and how righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:18428:206"/> ſoeuer their cauſe is. But (as I ſaid before) I meane not too largely to ſtand vpon any vſe, but only to point them out brieſly; therefore I will proceed.</p>
               <p>Another common vſe of the ſame doctrine, and not much vnlike the other, is, that that we do not only not contemne the children of God inwardly, neither only loue them, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly honor them, but that alſo we refraine from all other vnkindneſſe againſt them, and that we be ready to performe any curteſie vnto them. <hi>Let vs doe good vnto all</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>but especially to them that are of the houſhold of faith: Galat.</hi> 6. 10.

Who would be accounted behind in ſhewing kindneſſe to the children of a king? and to offer any vnkindneſſe to any of them, is little leſſe then treaſon. There is no vnkindneſſe offered to them, which is not more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to vs then hurtfull to them. There is no kindneſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to them, whereby we receiue not as much benefit as they: yea, much more, becauſe the beſtowing of it is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>to ſeed caſt vpon waters,</hi> that is, ſowen vpon the low grounds by the waters, that are alwaies moſt fruitfull: <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 1. and the recompence to be looked for for thereof is compared to the reaping in time of harueſt: <hi>Galat.</hi> 6. 8. 9 Other arguments for further proofe of this point haue been touched before: Chap. 12. in that which hath been written of the loue of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and chap. 21. where we heard of the efficacy of the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Gods children, as well for the wicked ſometimes, as for the godly, and chap. 28. where we intreated of the manifold benefits that other do injoy by Gods children: and finally in the laſt before of the promiſes of God to them that do ſhew any kindneſſe to his children. It ſhall not therefore be needfull to inlarge this vſe with any other arguments in this place. Let this only be added, that if men were perſwaded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of the excellency of the children of God, and of that gaine that is in ſhewing any kindneſſe vnto them, they would ſtrine who ſhould ſhew moſt, and euery man would think him happieſt that could ſhew moſt. Is it not ſo towards the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of eathly Princes? and that pattly becauſe of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:18428:206"/> and partly becauſe they hope one day to haue all plentifully recompenſed?</p>
               <p>This (no doubt) made <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> ſo forward to ſhew kindneſſe to the children of God, that the one ſate in his tent dore, the other at the gate of the city of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as looking for ſome of the children of God whom they might entertain with ſuch kindnes: and therefore alſo as being ready ſo to doe, and indeed they did accordingly. For they did no ſooner ſee the Angels of God comming towards them in the forme &amp; habit of men, but preſently they ran towards them, &amp; would neuer leaue them, till they had brought them into their houſes, and made them the beſt cheere they could: <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 1 and 19. 1. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This made the poore old labouring man of <hi>Gibeah</hi> be ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, that he did no ſooner ſee the Leuit and his concubin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> wandring about the ſtreets of the ſaid city without entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by any, but that vpon very little conference with them, and he complaining how deſtitute he was of lodging, through the inhumanity of that place, he without any further delay or deliberation ſpake moſt kindly vnto him, and did moſt curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly receiue him and his concubine into his houſe, miniſtring vnto them both, according to all their neceſſities: <hi>Iudg.</hi> 19. 20.</p>
               <p>This made the Shunamit to conſtraine <hi>Eliſha</hi> to eat bread in hir houſe, as alſo moſt earneſtly to perſwade her husband <hi>to make him a little chamber</hi> (of purpoſe) <hi>with walls, and a bed, and a table, and a ſtools and a candle ſticke, that be might</hi> (the oftner) <hi>turne in thither as he came that way:</hi> 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 8. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This made <hi>Tabuba</hi> (otherwiſe called <hi>Dorcas) full of good works and almes, and to make coats, and garments,</hi> for ſuch as could not make them for themſelues: <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 9. 33. and 39.</p>
               <p>This made <hi>Lydia,</hi> not only <hi>to beſeech Paul and Timothy,</hi> but alſo <hi>to conſtraine them (if they iudged her faithfull to the Lord) to come into her houſe, and to abide there: Acts</hi> 16. 15.</p>
               <p>This made <hi>Gaius</hi> ſo bountifull, in entertaining all the ſaints, that he is not only commended by <hi>Paul as his boſt, and the boſt of the whole Church: Rom.</hi> 16. 23. but that <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo teſtifieth of him and to him, that <hi>he did faithfully what ſoeuer he did to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and to ſtrangers, &amp;c. who alſo did beare witneſſe of his ſaid loue before the Churches:</hi> 3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.</p>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:18428:207"/>
               <p>How few ſuch are in theſe daies? How few men like to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> to <hi>Lot,</hi> to the old Gibeonite, and to <hi>Gaius?</hi> How few women, that for bounty and forwardneſſe therein, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the Shunamit, to <hi>Tabitha,</hi> and to <hi>Lydia?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A further common vſe of this doctrine, is to teach all both good and bad, the honorable condition of the miniſters of the word, by whom it pleaſeth God to call v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to be his children. Before indeed we heard the dignity of Gods children to be the greater, becauſe God emploied ſuch honorable perſons as the miniſters of the word are, in begetting them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. But as children are the more honorable, the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable their parents are, ſo ſometime alſo parents are made the more honorable by their children. Therefore the woman that heard the gratious words which came from our Sauiour, for his ſake commended his mother, crying out aloud before all the multitude preſent, <hi>Bleſſed is the wombe which bare th e, and the paps which thou haſt ſucked: Luk.</hi> 11 27. In like manner therefore we may now as well commend the honorable ſtate of the miniſters of the word, by the children of God inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally begotten by them to God, as before we amplified the dignity of Gods children, by the honor of the miniſters of the word. This is the more to be obſerued, becauſe in the firſt creation of man, God did all himſelfe alone, not vſing therein the miniſtery of any Angell.</p>
               <p>That now therefore in the ſecond creation, and reſtoring of man he imploieth men to effect the ſame, it is no ſmall grace and credit to them whom he doth ſo imploy; the rather becauſe it hath been before ſhewed, that this ſecond creation of man (in the iudgement of man) cannot but be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a far greater worke, then the firſt creation either of man only, or of all other things. Had I not been ſo plentifull as I haue been already in the former part of this treatiſe; and were not ſome other things remaining, not altogether to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the manifold indignities that in theſe laſt daies are euery where offered as generally to all the children of God, ſo ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the miniſters of the word, would require this vſe to be much ſtood vpon. Of many indignities ſo offered vnto the miniſters of the word, it is not the leaſt, but rather the chiefeſt,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:18428:207"/> and that which woundeth moſt, that ariſeth from the people themſelues, where ſuch miniſters haue exerciſed their gifts, and ſpent their ſtrength: and perhaps alſo (for example of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality to other, or by neceſſary charges) exhauſted their owne outward ſtates: hauing either nothing, or very little left for maintenance oſ themſelues in their age, when they moſt need comfort: or at leaſt not hauing halfe ſo much to leaue to many children, as their parents left to them alone. For ſuch to be neglected, and contemned: yea, alſo oppugned and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by their owne people with many vnkindneſſes, cannot but be a grieuous ſinne againſt God, and an heauy diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of ſuch miniſters.

               <p>Yea ſuch may rather feare, leſt by ſuch diſcouragements offred to their Miniſters (whereby they are forced to depart, and to ſeeke for more peace and comfort elſwhere) the Lord Ieſus Chriſt may ſay vnto them in behalfe of ſuch Miniſters, as ſometimes he ſaid to the Iewes touching himſelfe: viz. that when ſuch are ſo gone from them, <hi>then they ſeeke them, and ſhall not f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Another common vſe therfore of this doctrine of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the children of God is, that the more excellent we hear their ſtate and condition to be, the more all ſorts of men ſhould take delight and pleaſure in their ſociety and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

For if a little <hi>leauen ſowreth the whole lumpe:</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. and if <hi>euill words corrupt good manners, 1. Cor.</hi> 15. 33. then it cannot be, but that good words and the good behauiour of men, muſt be and are of great efficacy, not only to conuert at the firſt, but alſo afterward to ſtrengthen and further in all goodneſſe, them that are already conuerted. And this is taught both by our Sauiour: <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 16. and alſo by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter:</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. Therefore alſo, ſo amiable ſhould the ſociety of Gods children be to all, euen to the wicked, that although they ſhould not purpoſe to make vſe of the fellowſhip of Gods children to their conuerſion, yet if at any time they ſhould be violently depriued thereof, then they ſhould be ſo diſtempered (as it were) and diſquicted therwith, that nothing elſe ſhould pleaſe, ſatisfie, and content them, till they doe againe recouer the ſame.</p>
               <p>When the enemies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> by their exceeding importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity had ouercome <hi>Darius,</hi> for tne caſting of <hi>Daniel</hi> into the lyons denne, how was the ſaid <hi>Darius</hi> (though an heathen) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therwith? verily ſo, that <hi>he went into his palace, and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned faſting, and forbad the inſtruments of muſique to be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

If <hi>Darius</hi> (not only a wicked man, but alſo a meere heathen, and altogether out of the Church) were ſo affected, and ſo diſquieted with the loſſe of <hi>Daniels</hi> company for a time, till he recouered him againe, how ſhould all other wicked men (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially liuing within the Church) take their loſſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the godly, till the ſame be reſtored againe? Againe, if the company of ſome of the godly ought to be ſo amiable, and their abſence ſo dolefull (as it were) to the wicked them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, how amiable ſhould the communion of an whole Church be vnto them (yea, to all) ſo long as they may enioy it? And therefore wofull and dolefull ought the caſting of them out to be, from the communion of an whole Church, if they ſhall ſo continue in their wickedneſſe, as to deſerue the ſame? what then is to be ſaid, both of thoſe that are ſo contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matious and obſtinate, as to continue in their ſinnes till the Church proceed iuſtly and according to the rule of the word to the fearfull ſentence of excommunication againſt them, whereby they are giuen ouer vnto ſatan? and alſo of thoſe, that being ſo proceeded againſt, do not regard the ſame? and laſtly of thoſe that in a kind of pride, and high conceit of their owne excellency and ſufficiency, without iuſt and ſufficient cauſe, do make a wilfull ſeparation of themſelues from ſuch whole Churches as haue the pure miniſtery of the word, and adminiſtration of the ſacraments according to the word: and wherein they haue been bred and borne (not only as men, but as the children of God, if they haue at all receiued the ſpirit of adoption) and where alſo, after their regeneration, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their regeneration (if they be regenerated) they haue been maintained, nouriſhed, and increaſed by the ſincere milk of the word?</p>
               <p>To inlarge this point of the deſire of all men; yea, of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light that all men (euen the wicked) ſhould haue in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the godly, let the ſame be further applied to the matching of themſelues in mariage with the children of God: yea, though themſelues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And why ſhould any hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and noble perſonages in the world (being vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As it is honorable and no manner of diſparagement at all for the wicked (though neuer ſo nobly deſcended according to the fleſh) to match in mariage with the children of God, though in worldly reſpects, neuer ſo meanly borne (being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe as I ſaid for conditions fit to match with ſo honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons) ſo are ſuch matches likewiſe of no meane effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to draw ſuch wicked ones as ſometimes they match with, to be themſelues of the number of Gods children. So ſaith the Apoſtle (as before we heard) <hi>what knoweſt thou O wife, whether thou ſhalt ſaue thine husband? or what knoweſt thou O man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou ſhalt ſaue thy wife? 1.

               <p>Hereof <hi>Ruth</hi> is a moſt pregnant and liuely example: For being her ſelfe an heathen, and hauing matched with one of the ſonnes of <hi>Elimelech</hi> and <hi>Naomi,</hi> ſhe was ſo effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by this match, that after the death of her husband ſhe would by no meanes part from <hi>Naomi.</hi> Indeed <hi>Orpah</hi> that

The Lord do ſo to me, and more alſo, if ought but death depart thee and me: Ruth</hi> 1. 16. 17. O rare example! O noble paterne! O ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable preſident. Let not men therefore, only match and mate themſelues with them that are the children of God, but let them alſo ſo animate and hearten themſelues, to hold fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and communion with them, that albeit they ſhould be moſt earneſtly perſwaded by the children of God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to depart and forſake them, yet they do anſwer ſuch as ſhall ſo perſwade them, as <hi>Ruth</hi> did <hi>Naomi, Intreat vs not to leaue you, nor to depart from you, for whither ye goe, we will goe: where ye dwell, we will dwell, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea verily, the more ſtedfaſt ſhould all be in holding faſt the communion and fellowſhip of Gods children, in reſpect of thoſe benefits which before we haue heard in Chap. 28. to accrue and grow to all (eſpecially by mariage) matched and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with the godly: yea, not only to themſelues, but alſo to theirs. I write not this to incourage the children of God to match with the wicked (a thing much condemned as we haue heard) but to repreſſe the pride of the wicked in diſdaining the company of the godly: at leaſt all mariages with them, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if there be any imparity on their part to the godly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of nobility, worſhip, or portion: yea not ſo only; but alſo to teach them notwithſtanding to match themſelues and their children, with Gods children, (if by any meanes they may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine therunto) in reſpect of the dignity &amp; excellency of them; as alſo of thoſe benefits that may be expected by them.</p>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:18428:210"/>
               <p>Now although theſe vſes hitherto mentioned be common both to the wicked, and alſo to the children of God; yet they are to be acknowledged principally to belong to the children of God themſelues. They principally are to honour them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their dignities, and to vſe them kindly according to their neceſſities. They principally are reuerently to regard the Miniſters of the word, whom God hath ordained as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall fathers to beget children to himſelfe. They princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally are to take delight, both generally in the ſocietie of the children of God, and alſo more particularly in matching and making mariages with them.</p>
               <p>Yea they that are moſt noble and wealthy are not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine them that in worldly reſpects are baſe and poore. Who may for nobility and riches bee preferred before <hi>Dauid,</hi> by God himſelfe aduanced to a kingdome? Yet he generally of the company of the children of God ſaith, that <hi>all his delight was in them that were excellent in the earth: Pſalm</hi> 16. 3. And againe: <hi>I am a companion</hi> (not of ſome, as of ſome of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and wealthieſt, but) <hi>of all them that feare thee, and keepe thy precepts:</hi> viz. how baſe or poore ſoeuer they be, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 63. Therefore touching the wicked, hee doth not onely ſay, <hi>I haue not haunted with vaine perſons, neither kept companie with the diſſemblers: I haue bated the aſſembly of the euill, and haue not companied with the wicked: Pſal.</hi> 26. 4. 5. neither, <hi>I haue ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them that giue themſelues to deceitfull vanities: Pſalm.</hi> 31. 6. neither againe, <hi>Doe not I hate them (O Lord) that hate thee? and doe not I earneſtly contend with them that riſe vp againſt thee? I hate them with an vnfained hatred, as they were mine enemies: Pſal.</hi> 139. 21. 22. <hi>Dauid</hi> (I ſay) doth not only ſay thus touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wicked, but to ſhew his deteſtation of them the more, hee ſaith with great vemency <hi>Away from me</hi> (or auant) <hi>yee wicked for I will keepe</hi> (or <hi>that I may keepe) the commandements of my God.</hi> Pſal. 119. 115. ſo nothing, that no man can keepe the commandements of God, except with great deteſtation he reiect and renounce the company of the wicked.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpake thus generally of the ſociety of the godly, and therefore contrarily of the fellowſhip of the wicked (to
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:18428:211"/> note that none can delight in the godly, that abhorreth not the vngodly) ſo for mariage, though hee were the anointed heire apparant of the Crowne and Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Prophet that had compoſed diuers Pſalmes before, yet hee diſdained not to match with the widow of the churle and perfect country clowne <hi>Nabal,</hi> becauſe by her wiſdome ſhee had ſhewed her ſelfe to be one of the daughters of God. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 39.</p>
               <p>Thus much for thoſe vſes of the former doctrine of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of Gods children, which are common to all. Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe which are more ſpeciall. Theſe are twofold: viz. either concerning the wicked and ſuch as are in their naturall ſtate, not regenerated, or belonging and proper to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, new borne, that haue <hi>receiued the ſpirit of adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby they call God their father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the wicked, as they may heereby ſee their owne wofull and fearefull ſtate and condition, the ſame hauing been in the former arguments ſhewed to bee in all things (or moſt things) contrary to the ſtate and condition of the children of God: ſo let them learne to abhorre the ſame, and in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nner to diſlike of themſelues as they are vnregenerated, that they may make the more haſte to change their copie (as wee vſe to ſpeake) and to come out from among them that are of their owneſort, and to ioine themſelues with the children of God, and to be one of them.</p>
               <p>The wicked and vnregenerated thinke themſelues the only happie men of the world. But alas, how they are deceiued may appeare by the premiſes. Not onely is the pooreſt, the meaneſt, the weakeſt and the ſickeſt, the baſeſt, the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and forlorne childe of God (deſtitute I meane of all worldly helpe and comfort) in farre better ſtate then the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Monarke in the world, that is not by regeneration the childe of God: but ſuch an vnregenerated man is alſo in farre worſe ſtate and condition then any worme, any toad, or any other creature whatſoeuer, and that both for this life and for the life to come.</p>
               <p>For this life, becauſe euery other creature hath all things <note place="margin">Note:</note> neceſſary for the kinde thereof, without any care, and without
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:18428:211"/> any griefe or ſorrow. What mighty Monarke had euer ſo?</p>
               <p>For the life to come, becauſe all other things periſh with their life, but the wicked remaine in their ſoules, and are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Hell, there to bee reſerued in chaines and vnſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble torments till the laſt iudgement day, when their bodies alſo ſhall be raiſed againe, and ioined to their owne ſoules, and ſo both in ſoule and bodie they ſhall bee caſt againe into hell fire, prepared for the Diuell and his Angels, thence neuer to bee deliuered, but there to be tormented for euermore, as before hath beene ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Should not this make them to make all haſte to forſake this ſtate, and to ioine themſelues to the children of God?</p>
               <p>Neither let them feare ſo to doe, whatſoeuer their former ſinnes haue beene. For if once they ſee and diſlike their vnregenerated ſtate, then are they in the way to adoption and regeneration. Such came Chriſt to heale, and to call to repentance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 12. 13. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 10. Such Chriſt hath promiſed to comfort, and to eaſe of the heauie burden of their ſinnes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. Such haue the better war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſo to doe, becauſe it is written by the Prophet <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie,</hi> that <hi>the Lord of boſts had ſaid, that in theſe laſt daies ten men out of all languages of the nations ſhould take hold of the skirt of him that is a Iew, and ſay, Wee will goe with you, for wee haue heard that God is with you: Zecbar.</hi> 8. 23. Other Prophets alſo before had written to the ſame purpoſe thus: <hi>It ſhall bee in the laſt daies, that the mountain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And many people ſhall goe and ſay, Come and let vs goe vp to the mountaine of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob, and be will teach vs his waies, and we will walke in his pathes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Mich</hi> 4 1.</p>
               <p>Many other the like promiſes there are for the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all (how wicked ſoeuer) to change their ſtate, and to make haſte in that behalfe, before they periſh in their wicked condition.</p>
               <p>The examples likewiſe of thoſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. of the gaoler, <hi>Act.</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:18428:212"/> 16. 27. of <hi>Paul</hi> him-ſelfe, of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> of all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then conuerted by the Apoſtles, and infinit other, may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encourage men vnto this haſt, for entring into the way of adoption.</p>
               <p>If once they enter, let them proceed and goe forward: not halfe way, but throughout, and to the end. <hi>Agrippa</hi> was halfe, yea almoſt perſwaded to bee a Chriſtian: <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 28. but wee read not, that hee was altogether perſwaded ſo to bee a Chriſtian. Though wee may not abſolutely ſay that hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer afterward fully and wholly became a Chriſtian, yet that (but almoſt) mentioned in the Scripture, and no more either there, or in any other place being teſtified of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conuerſion, may iuſtly make vs all the more to doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Many in the daies of Chriſt were his Diſciples for a time, who at the laſt tooke ſuch offence at his Doctrine, <hi>that they went backe, and walked no more with him: Iohn.</hi> 6. 66. After that, many were followers of the Apoſtles, who afterward forſooke them: 2. <hi>Tim</hi> 4 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>It is a dangerous thing thus to enter, and not to go forward: <hi>No man that putteth his hand to the plough, and looketh backe, is apt to the Kingdome of God: Luk.</hi> 9. 62. As this is true in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular calling to the miniſtery, ſo much more in the generall to Chriſtianity, <hi>If any after they haue eſcaped from the filthineſſe of the world,</hi> (that is, after they made profeſſion of renouncing the filthineſſe of the world) <hi>through the knowledge of the Lord, and of the Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, are yet intangled therein againe, and ouercome, the latter end is worſe with them then the beginning, &amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
               <p>The meanes whereby they that are wicked may be releaſed of the bondage of their ſinne, and made the children of God, is (as wee haue heard) principally the miniſterie of the word.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the ſocietie and fellowſhip of them that are the children of God already, as before wee heard.</p>
               <p>If notwithſtanding all hitherto ſaid, they that are wicked, will not forſake their wickedneſſe, but will ſtill remaine ſuch as they are, yet let them take heed of all wrongs and iniuries
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:18428:212"/> againſt them that are the children of God, leſt in the end it be to their coſt, and they repent, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, when it is too late. But of this point alſo before.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the vſes of the doctrine of the dignitie of Gods children which are proper and ſpeciall to the wicked.</p>
               <p>Touching them that are the children of God indeed, let them eſpecially firſt of all take heed that they fall not from their excellent ſtate. It is true indeed, that they that are once truly the children of God, ſhall euer ſo continue, and cannot fall away. Howbeit, we are exhorted often to take heed to our ſelues in this behalfe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12. and 10. 23. and 12 15. and elſwhere, becauſe exhortations are the ſpecialleſt meanes for our vpholding.</p>
               <p>Wee condemne all, that being but baſe and beggarly, and yet taken into ſome noble mans or gentlemans houſe and ſeruice, where they are in the way to preferment, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keepe themſelues well whiles they are well. Eſpecially wee condemne them, that hauing found ſuch fauour with Princes, as that from a low degree they are aduanced to ſome honourable condition (as the Earle of TERONE and other) cannot containe themſelues, but breake their liſts, and ſo bring themſelues to their former baſeneſſe. How much more then may they be condemned, that being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from death to life, from darkeneſſe to light, from bondage to libertie, from ſeruants and ſlaues of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, to bee the ſonnes and daughters of God, from Hell to Heauen, doe what in themlieth to returne againe to their former miſerie?</p>
               <p>Although indeed the true children of God can neuer bee altogether vnchilded (as it were) and vtterly degraded, yet they in particular things ſo fall, yea generally for a time ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, that they may ſeeme, and often times ſeeme to other and to themſelues, neuer to haue beene the children of God. All this is by negligence and ſecuritie.

               <p>A ſecond ſpeciall vſe for the children of God is, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing found this loue before ſpoken of, with God, to be made his children, they truſt in him, and depend on him, not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but that hee that hath made them his children, and will giue them a kingdome fit for ſuch children, wil alſo, and much more, giue them all things for this life: <hi>Luk</hi> 12. 32. Our little children when they riſe in the morning, yea our ſeruants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, take no care what they ſhall eat, or what they ſhall drinke; but they leaue all ſuch care to vs their fathers and their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and it is indeed our duty to prouide all ſuch things for them. <hi>For he that prouideth not for his owne, and namely for them of his houſhold, denieth the faith, and is worſe then an infi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hitherto belongeth the ſpeech of <hi>Moſes</hi> vnto God, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 12. 13. and the practiſe of <hi>Bathſhebaes</hi> huſwife, <hi>Prou.</hi> 31. 15. Why then ſhould not we much more, that profeſſe our ſelues the children of God, caſt all our care vpon our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie father that careth for vs? 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. Vnder this vſe I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend infinite comfort of the children of God.</p>
               <p>The grounds of this comfort being handled before, and ſome of them to be touched againe in the next verſe, I ſhall not need to ſtand vpon them now.</p>
               <p>Yea with this truſt in God, and comfort from God, we may ioine patience both towards God, and alſo towards men. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, becauſe we haue heard before, that he correcteth vr onely in loue, and for our great good, <hi>that wee may not bee condemned with the world:</hi> 1. <hi>Cor. 11. 12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Towards man, becauſe hee is but Gods hand to chaſtiſe vs, and cannot goe beyond his commiſſion: and laſt of all, ſhall himſelfe be called to account for whatſoeuer wrong hee doth vnto vs. God himſelfe will iudge and reuenge our cauſe for vs: yea the more that we hold our peace, and put vp all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſiſtance or murmuring. As <hi>it is the glory of a man ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to paſſe by an offenſe, Pro.</hi> 19. 11. ſo eſpecially is it the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the childe of God. It is no credit for a man to ſtriue with a boy, nor for the ſonnes of Nobles to contend with baſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: yea it is moſt for their credit, with a kinde of diſdaine and contempt to let ſuch perſons goe without any reuenge, as though they had offred them no indignity.</p>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:18428:213"/>
               <p>The application of this wee haue heard before, in ſpeaking of the true nobility and magnanimity of Gods children.</p>
               <p>A third vſe is, that they loue him that hath loued them, as before we heard. Wee looke that our children loue vs better then other, though other bee better able to preferre them. How much more ſhould we loue God that is Almighty?</p>
               <p>A fourth vſe of the dignity of Gods children, for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God themſelues, is, that they are aduanced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This walking worthy of our calling, and this honouring of God our father, conſiſteth in two things: Firſt, in hearing of his word: ſecondly, in walking according to his word, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming our ſelues to the likeneſſe of God himſelfe. <hi>My ſonne, heare thy fathers inſtruction and forſake not thy mothers teaching, Pro.</hi> 18. <hi>He that is of God, heareth Godsword.

               <p>The hearing of Gods word is nothing without obedience, and conforming our ſelues vnto God. <hi>As obedient children, faſhion not your ſelues vnto the former lusts of your ignorance: but as he which hath called you is holy, ſo be yee holy in all maner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And if yee call him father, which without reſpect of perſons iudgeth euery man according to his worke, paſle the time of your dwelling heere in feare:</hi> 1.

That which is ſpoken of theſe particulars, is to be vnderſtood of all other parts of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. Wherby we do reſemble God, as in mercy: <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 36. and in forgiuing one another: <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 32. and in other the like.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are the markes of Gods children, without which in truth, and in ſome meaſure, neither other can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them, nor themſelues can know themſelues to be the children of God.</p>
               <p>Theſe robes and ornaments being once put on, muſt neuer be put off, and laid vp for high daies; and ſolemne aſſemblies; but they muſt be worne at all times, and in all meetings. Much vſe, weareth and conſumeth other ornaments, but the more theſe ornaments are worne, the better they are.</p>
               <p>Thus the Iſraelites were commanded <hi>to walke in the waies of God: Deut.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>Salomon</hi> is commended <hi>for louing the Lord, and walking in the ordinances of Dauid his father:</hi> 1.<hi>Kings</hi> 3. 3.</p>
               <p>So the Rechabits are in ſome ſort commended for obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ordinances of their Father, and by their example the Iewes are condemned for not hauing the like regard of the ordinances of God: <hi>Ierem. 32. 5. &amp;c.</hi> On the contrary, the ſonnes of <hi>Samuel</hi> are diſcommended for not <hi>walking
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:18428:214"/> in the waies of Samuel:</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
               <p>The application of theſe examples is ſo eaſie, that I need not to ſtand vpon it.</p>
               <p>This is the ſumme of all, that the more God hath dignified vs, in making vs his children, the more we honor him, by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his word, and keeping his commandements. The more we do for our own children, or ſhew kindneſſe to any other, the more duty we looke for from our own children; and the more alſo we expect, that they to whom we ſhew kindneſſe ſhould both regard our words, and alſo do that which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them Shall we that are but Gods inſtruments in all that we do: and that do nothing, neither can do any thing in reſpect of this our adoption whereby God aduanceth vs to be of beggers and rebells his children, and heires, euen heires to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his owne Son Ieſus Chriſt; ſhall we (I ſay) look for ſo much ſeruice and duty at the hands of other, that are in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpects our equalls, if not in ſome our betters, (though we in ſome other are in the world their ſuperiors) and ſhall we not performe much more vnto God? One maine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that kept <hi>Ioſeph</hi> from yeelding to the filthy deſire, and wicked requeſt of his miſtriſſe, was the conſideration of that which his maſter had done for him. <hi>My maſter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>knoweth not what he hath in the houſe with me: but hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all that he hath to mine hand. There is no man greater in this houſe then I: neither hath hee kept any thing from mee but thee, becauſe thou art his wife: how then can I doe this great wickedneſſe, and ſo ſinne againſt God? Geneſ.</hi> 39. 8. 9. If <hi>Ioſeph</hi> made ſuch conſcience of dutie towards his maſter, becauſe he had ſo graced and aduanced him in his family, though he were ſtill but a ſeruant, what conſcience are we to make of all duty to God for honouring of him, that being ſo baſe and vile as wee were, are by him aduanced to be his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?</p>
               <p>That we may thus heare and obey God, it becommeth vs eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to auoid the ſociety of the wicked, before lightly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. And indeed what greater diſgrace for the ſonnes of a Prince and a mighty monarke, then to confort with clownes and ſcullians, and ſuch like? Much more may bee ſaid of
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:18428:215"/> the diſgrace of the children of God by the communion and fellowſhip of the wicked. If we cannot auoid their company, yet let vs take heed of all pollution by them. <hi>Noah</hi> and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily liued amids the whole ſinfull and wicked world: and <hi>Lot</hi> among the filthy Sodomits: yet theſe kept themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted. Our Sauiour ſaith to the Angell of the Church of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, Thou haſt a few names yet in Sardi which haue not deſiled their garments: Reu.</hi> 3. 4. yet theſe few liued amongſt a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that had a name to be aliue and yet were dead. Howſoeuer therfore we be thruſt and thronged with the wicked, yet ſuch muſt be our care for our ſelues that their ſoily and filthy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may not defile and pollute ours.</p>
               <p>We muſt alſo take heed of too much worldlineſſe: leſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we be defiled, and do ſpot thoſe ornaments and rich robes before ſpoken of: we <hi>muſt vſe the world as if we vſed it not.</hi> As the moule alwaies liueth in the earth, and yet keepeth her skinne as faire, as cleane, and as fine as the beſt and moſt curiouſly bruſhed veluet gowne in a kingdome, ſo muſt we keep our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, and all the robes thereof. euen in the mids of this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and therfore moſt dangerous age.</p>
               <p>This caueat, thus to looke to our ſelues in reſpect of the world is very neceſſary.

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He former part of this text being alreadie handled, it remaineth now to ſpeake of the ſecond: viz. of the Apoſtles anſwer to an obiection that might be made againſt that which the Apoſtle had ſpoken, and which I haue now more plentifully laid forth, of the dignity of Gods children. This I will but run ouer in a trice, becauſe that which I haue written was the principall point, the which at the firſt I intended and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto my ſelfe. That which remaineth, is but an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix of the former, and therefore it needeth not ſo largely to be handled.</p>
               <p>The obiection which might haue been made againſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles former commendation of Gods loue in making vs his children, is this. Is the loue of God ſo great, ſo vnſpeakable, and ſo admirable in making vs his children? And is our ſtate and condition in being the children of God, ſo worthy, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, ſo honorable? How can this be, ſith of all other men in the world, we are leaſt reſpected, leaſt regarded? yea, we are not ſo much as knowen (almoſt) in the world? To this the Apoſtle giueth a double anſwer: or acknowledging indeed the thing obiected, viz. that we are not regarded, yea, not ſo much as known in the world, he giueth a double reaſon why the world
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:18428:216"/> doth ſo little reſpect vs, ſcarce knowing vs: namely, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it knoweth not God himſelfe, in this verſe: ſecondly, becauſe it is not yet euident to the world what wee ſhall bee heereafter, in the beginning of the next verſe.</p>
               <p>Before we come to the words themſelues, let vs note, and only note this, that whoſoeuer will commend any thing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as worthy of their conſideration and obſeruation, they muſt before alſo thinke of that which may and will be obiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the ſame, as alſo prepare anſwer to the ſaid obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For there is nothing ſo holy, ſo excellent, ſo ſound, but that the wit of man hath ſomewhat, or will haue ſomewhat to obiect to the diſgracing, abaſing, and peruerting thereof. Therefore the Lord hath giuen vs ſuch a word, euen ſuch a Scripture and written word, as is not only <hi>profitable or ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to teach</hi> (namely the truth) but alſo to <hi>improoue</hi> (or to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince and confute all errours, and whatſoeuer may bee obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt the ſaid truth) neither onely <hi>to inſtruct in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> (that is, to exhort vs vnto all vertue) <hi>but alſo to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> (or to reprooue all vice, and whatſoeuer may bee ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vertue) <hi>that ſo the man of God</hi> (that is, the Miniſter of the word) <hi>may be abſolute, being made perfect vnto all good works.</hi> This might largely bee prooued by infinite examples in the Scriptures: but as I promiſed only to note it, ſo I wil performe my promiſe in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>To returne therefore to the words of the Apoſtle, let vs firſt ſee the meaning of the ſaid words, and then the matter it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The firſt word <hi>[the world]</hi> hath diuers ſignifications. Firſt, it ſignifieth the whole maſſe and lumpe of all Gods creatures, eſpecially viſible: as when it is ſaid, that <hi>God made the world: Act.</hi> 17. 24. and that <hi>hee choſe vs before the foundations of the world were laid: Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. Secondly, it ſignifieth this inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our part of the world, with all things therein contained, or thereto belonging. So it is ſaid, the diuell did <hi>ſhew vnto Chriſt all the kingdomes of the world, Matth.</hi> 4 8. And <hi>the field is the world, Matth.</hi> 13. 38. And, <hi>He was the light, that ligtneth euery one that commeth into the world: Ioh.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Hee was in the world:</hi> verſe 10. And, <hi>Loue not the world, neither the things that are in the world:</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:18428:216"/>
               <p>Thirdly, it is taken for the elect men of the world: <hi>Behold the Lambe of God, which taketh away the ſinnes of the world: Ioh.</hi> 1. 29. <hi>So God loued the world: Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>He ſent not his ſonne that the world might be condemned, but that the world might be ſaued:</hi> verſe 17. Fourthly it is vſed only for the wicked of the world, and for all men vnregenerated, and that for two reaſons. Firſt, becauſe they ſauor only the things of this world, and do mind nothing but worldly things: Secondly becauſe they are the greateſt part of the world; and for the moſt part beare the chiefeſt ſway and ſwinge in the world, as though they were the only lords and kings of the world: whereas indeed the leaſt part is theirs: yea, they haue no right or intereſt to any thing in the world, as hath been before ſhewed. The word tranſlated world, naturally ſignifieth order, or ornament, and beauty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe indeed all things were at the firſt created in moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent order, and were ſo beautifull, that they were a great orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to God himſelfe, the creator of them. Now the wicked are not only the greateſt part, bearing the greateſt ſway and ſwinge in the world; but alſo accordingly, they are the only gallants (outwardly) of the world: brauing it out aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſuch manner, that if they were out of the world, the world might ſeem to be no world, and to haue no beauty in it. In this ſignification is the word taken when it is ſaid, <hi>the world knew not: Ioh.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me firſt. If ye were of the world, the world would loue his owne: but becauſe ye are not of the world, but I haue choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you: Ioh.</hi> 15. 18. 19. So it is taken: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 8. <hi>He ſhall reproue the world of ſinne:</hi> and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>I pray not for the world.</hi> So it is taken in many other places. Theſe are the principall ſignifications of this word world, and in this fourth ſignification it is taken in this place. The next word here, is the word <hi>knoweth.</hi> To omit the diuers ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this word in other places, here it ſignifieth (as before hath been inſinuated) not to acknowledge, not to regard, or reſpect. So it is ſaid that our Sauiour ſhall ſay at the laſt day to them that ſhall plead their prophecying, and caſting out of diuels in his name, <hi>I neuer knew you, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 7. 23. that is, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer approued you, liked you, or regarded you.
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:18428:217"/> Yea, here, as the words <hi>Despiſe not prophecying,</hi> 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 20. import not only, that they ſhould not contemne it, but alſo that they ſhould honorably regard it, ſo this word <hi>not to know,</hi> in this place ſignifieth not only, not to regard, or reſpect, but alſo to contemne and deſpiſe: yea, to hate, and to proſecute, and to perſecute, with all euil. So it is taken elſe where: <hi>All theſe things will they doe vnto you for my names ſake: becauſe they haue not knowen him that ſent me: Ioh. 15. 21. Theſe things will they doe vnto you, becauſe they haue not known the father, nor me: Ioh.</hi> 16. 3. In both theſe places <hi>not to know</hi> ſignifieth, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t only to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or to neglect, or not to regard, but alſo to contemne and deſpiſe. The ſame is the ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this phraſe in this place. The meaning therefore of theſe words <hi>(for this cauſe the world knoweth you not)</hi> is this, that for this cauſe the wicked &amp; vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated of the world do not acknowledge and regard you, that is, they do contemne, deſpiſe and perſecute you: ſo alſo of the words following, <hi>becauſe it knoweth not him,</hi> that is, becauſe they regard not or reſpect not himſelfe: yea, becauſe they contemn and deſpiſe, and (what they can) doe alſo perſecute him. Thus we ſee the obiection that might be made againſt the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Gods children to be taken from the hatred of the world, that is, of all the vnregenerate in the world againſt them: and the anſwer thereunto to be, that this is not a thing to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled at, or ſo to be taken, that we ſhould be diſcouraged by it, &amp; the more think the dignity of Gods children not to be ſo excellent as before the Apoſtle had commended it to be, for as much as they that do thus little regard and brook Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yea hate and deſpiſe them, do as little regard, &amp; as hardly brook God himſelſe: yea, they hate and deſpiſe him. And this their not knowing of God; yea their hatred and deſpiſing of God, is the very cauſe why ſuch do not know the children of God, but hate and deſpiſe them.</p>
               <p>The truth of both theſe, viz. that all the wicked do hate and deſpiſe both the children of God, &amp; alſo God himſelf, and that they do therfore hate and deſpiſe his children, becauſe they do firſt hate and deſpiſe him, is ſufficiently euident by the places before alledged: For the ſaid places do not only manifeſt the ſignification of the words &amp; phraſes, but the truth alſo of the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:18428:217"/> things themſelues. And the reaſon why the wicked do make ſo little reckning of Gods children, &amp; of God himſelfe; yea why they hate &amp; contemn both, is becauſe of the great contrariety that is betwixt them, &amp; betwixt Gods children, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: euen as great as is betwixt light &amp; darknes: betwixt good and euil. As God himſelf <hi>is light and hath no darknes in him: 1. Ioh.</hi> 1. 5. ſo they <hi>that haue fellowſhip with him, and walke in light</hi> (euen all his children) are called <hi>the children of light and of the day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. Theſ.</hi> 5. 5. and <hi>lights</hi> themſelues: <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 15. Therfore as God himſelfe doth hate &amp; condemne all darknes, and all works of darknes, ſo his children do the like, and cannot beare them in the wicked, <hi>but do reproue them rather: Ephe</hi> 5. 11. This then is the reaſon of the hatred of the wicked againſt the children of God, and againſt God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And this hatred is manifeſt by examples of ſuch, as being bound one to another by the bond of nature, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hate them to whom they are ſo bound, euen becauſe of the light that is in them, wherby they ſhew themſelues <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the light,</hi> euen of God himſelfe. So <hi>Cain</hi> hated <hi>Abel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his own works were euill, and his brothers good:</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 12. So <hi>Iſhmael</hi> hated <hi>Eſau Iacob: Saul</hi> both <hi>Dauid</hi> and alſo his own ſonne <hi>Ionathan,</hi> for his good loue towards <hi>Dauid.</hi> The like may be ſaid of many other: yea indeed, of the hatred of al that are wicked, againſt the godly. That ſomtimes the wicked are ſaid to loue the children of God, yea alſo to reuerence them, &amp; to ſhew them much kindnes: it is firſt of al for other cauſes and reſpects, not for their godlines: as for their beauty: their skill in muſick, or in ſome other ſuch thing: for their policie, and for ſuch like: as before in handling the maine exhortation we haue ſhewed. Secondly it is by the ouerruling hand and ſpirit of God, to ſhew that he hath the hearts of all men in his hand: and that he can as well draw loue, (or at leaſt kindneſſe) from the heart that naturally is poſſeſſed with hatred, as he can fetch water out of the rocke, and make the rauenous rauens to be nurſing mothers (as it were) to his children; and as he can reſtraine the fire from burning ſo much as an haire of his children, being caſt into the mids thereof, or the woollie nappe of their garments. But howſoeuer the Lord doe this
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:18428:218"/> ſometimes, yet there is in all the wicked ſuch a ſecret hatred againſt all the children of God, and againſt God himſelfe, that except God do reſtraine them, or force them to worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their nature, they cannot but break foorth into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and into all wrongs and indignities againſt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and God himſelfe. And ſo they bewray, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they haue ſome generall and ſpeculatiue knowledge of God himſelfe, by his works and word, and of his children, by thoſe graces of God in them, wherby they doe reſemble him, and ſhew themſelues to be his children, yet they haue no true knowledge either of God, or of his children, becauſe they doe not perſorme thoſe duties to God and to his children, which do belong vnto them.</p>
               <p>And this is a common phraſe amongſt vs, to ſay that a man knoweth not another, when hee performeth not that dutie which belongeth to his place. Many times we paſſe by great nobles, and other of high calling without any reuerence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, becauſe indeed we know them not. If alſo wee be brought before them, and yet do not reſpect and honor them according to their places and authority, we are and may be iuſtly charged, that we do not know them: yea, oft times we are and may be iuſtly threatned, to be taught to know them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we goe. And indeed if men knew Gods iuſtice againſt ſinne, his mercy towards them that loue, feare and obey him; his reckoning that he maketh of all his children; his large promiſes (before ſpoken of) made to all that doe ſhew any kindneſſe to any of them: his contrary threatnings to them that doe the contrary vnto them: his power and might to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme both all his promiſes, and alſo all his threatnings: and laſtly his faithfulneſſe in performing of them to the full: if (I ſay) the wicked knew theſe things of God, then certainly it could not be, but that they would more reſpect his children, then they doe.</p>
               <p>For as much therefore as they doe not reſpect them, but are as ſtrange towards them as if they had neuer knowen or ſeen them, and deale as hardly with them as if they were their enemies (by whom notwithſtanding they do daily enioy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great benefits, as hath been before declared) therefore we
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:18428:218"/> may well conclude with the Apoſtle, that they know them not: and that the cauſe why they know them not, is, becauſe they know not God himſelfe: Though they know him ſo, that they be able to ſpeake of him, and to preach the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him to other, yet they know him not in truth truly, and ſo as that themſelues ſhall be any whit the better by their knowledge. Yea, the more they know him without honoring of him, according to their knowledge, with the more ſtripes they ſhall be beaten, the greater ſhall be their condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore indeed they were better in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to be altogether ignorant of him, then ſo only to know him.</p>
               <p>The wicked know the children of God as they are men: as they are of this or that fauor, ſtature, and complexion: as they are rich or poore: as they haue ſome place and authority in the world: but yet they know them not, neither regard them, as they are the children of God; and that becauſe they know not God himſelfe. They knew them before they were the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; they loued them and reſpected them, whiles they were as themſelues; naturall men, vnregenerated men, wicked men: but as ſoone as there is a change made in them, and that they do <hi>receiue the ſpirit of adoption,</hi> preſently they are alſo changed. As it is with many, that whiles they were yong, and in their youth liued together, and were well acquainted one with another: but afterward by long abſence and many yeers being both changed, growen to be men, hauing haire on their faces: yea perhaps being gray-headed, they meet one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in the face, and yet ſalute not one another, neither ſpeake one to another, becauſe indeed they haue forgotten one another, and do not know one another: ſo is it betwixt the wicked and the children of God, being once taken from out of the wicked, and adopted to bee the children of God: In one day there is a greater change made in the heart, then there is in the face, and in the ſtature by many yeeres. Greater (I ſay) becauſe this change by grace is meerly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but the other change before ſpoken of in nature, is only diuers.</p>
               <p>Touching the cauſe of the change of the affections of the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:18428:219"/> wicked towards the children of God, viz. becauſe they know not God himſelfe, it may be fitly illuſtrated by the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men. For as it often falleth out, that the children of great perſons in the world trauelling or liuing in places where their parents are not knowen, do meet with the harder mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and are the more roughly vſed, and receiue the more wrongs and indignities, becauſe ſuch as do ſo vſe them, (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abuſe them,) do not know their parents; ſo is it with the children of God in reſpect of the wicked. They liue in this world <hi>as ſtrangers and pilgrims: 1. Pet.</hi> 2. 11. (and ſo they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, their country being aboue in heauen) and by this means they receiue much wrong, and many iniuries from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked amongſt whom they liue; euen becauſe thoſe that doe them theſe wrongs and iniuries, doe not know God himſelfe, the father of the godly. It was through ignorance of <hi>Pauls</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Roman, that he was bound to be ſcourged, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he reuealed himſelfe to be a Roman, he eſcaped the whip; and they that before had giuen commandement for the whipping of him, began to feare, and to reuoke their ſaid commandement: <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 25. In like manner therefore, it is not to bee maruelled, that they which know not God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, doe deale the more hardly with his children, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which our Sauiour expreſly ſaith in this caſe: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 2. 3. as before was alledged.</p>
               <p>From this obiection and firſt anſwer therunto, we learn two points: Firſt, that whoſoeuer will be the children of God, muſt prepare and arme themſelues for the hatred of the world: euen to be contemned, deſpiſed, reproued, and perſecuted in the world, and of the men of the world. If we will <hi>be glorified with Chriſt,</hi> we muſt alſo <hi>ſuffer with Chriſt</hi> as his <hi>members: Rom.</hi> 8. 17.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Whoſoeuer will follow me</hi> (viz. ſo that he may come to my glory) <hi>let him forſake himſelfe, and take vp his croſſe, and follow me: Mark.</hi> 8. 34. Yea <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, that ſuch an one <hi>muſt take vp his Croſſe daily: Luk.</hi> 9. 23. Thereby noting that all the wicked that will be Chriſts diſciples, muſt not looke for ſome affliction, at the firſt entrance into that ſtate, or now and then, but continually, euen euery day. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If we ſuffer we ſhall reigne with him: 2. Tim.</hi> 2. 12. ſo inſinuating, that the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:18428:219"/> way to raigne, is firſt to ſuffer. Yea, he ſpeaketh more plainly, and more generally, ſaying, that <hi>All that will liue godly in Chriſt Ieſus muſt ſuffer perſecution: 2. Tim.</hi> 3. 12. Therefore out of the Prophet he ſpeaketh in the perſon of all the godly, and ſaith, <hi>For thy ſake are we killed all day long, we are counted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter: Rom.</hi> 8. 36. This was the way by which Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus himſelfe entred into his glory: <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 26. 1. <hi>Pet. 1 11. The ſeruant is no greater then his Maſter. If therefore the world haue perſecuted the maſter</hi> (Chriſt himſelfe) will they not <hi>perſecute vs</hi> that are his ſeruants? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 20. Shall we (I ſay) goe ſcotfree? and looke to aſcend into heauen with eaſe, and to be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thither (as it were) in our down beds? Shall the Captaine only take paines and fight, &amp;c. and ſhall the common ſouldier ſit ſtill, eating and drinking, and making merry? No, no, It ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath beene ſo: It neuer ſhall be ſo. <hi>Though Chriſt were the Sonne, yet hee learned obedience by the things which he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Hebr.</hi> 5. 8. Yea, <hi>It became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, ſeeing that hee brought many children vnto glorie, that hee ſhould conſecrate the Prince of their Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through afflictions: Hebrew.</hi> 2. 10. Hath our Prince gone by this way of afflictions, and ſhall wee ſeeke to ſhift it, and looke to goe another way? What a ſhame were this for vs, to be ſo ſquamiſh, ſo nice, ſo dainty? eſpecially we being ſo baſe, ſo vile, and ſo contemptible as wee are in reſpect of our Prince? Away therefore with ſuch ſluggiſh feares, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: Away with ſuch ſoftneſſe and tenderneſſe. Let vs make as full reckoning (if we will be chriſtians indeede as well as in name) to ſuffer perſecutions, as we are ſure of the coat of our backes. Let vs daily looke for it: Let vs dailie buckle our ſelues vnto it. And ſo the more wee looke for it, and the better we are armed to it, the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily we ſhall ouercome it: yea, we ſhall find more comfort and ioy in ſuch ſufferings for Chriſts ſake, then all the wicked in the world doe, in all their eaſe, in all their dainty fare, in all their riches and glory, in all their ſports, delights and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
               <p>Yea, the truth is, that we ſhould ſo looke for trouble in the world, and be alwaies ſo prepared to ſuffer for Chriſts ſake,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:18428:220"/> that if the world laugh or ſmile vpon vs, &amp; fauor vs, we ſhould the more feare our ſtate, &amp; doubt whether yet we be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God or no: ſuch as we haue been accounted by other; <note place="margin">Note.</note> and ſuch as we haue taken our ſelues to be. Laſt of all (for this point) let vs vnderſtand, that as all the children of God muſt make reckning not to be known in the world, that is, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe many troubles, euen for that cauſe; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle here, <hi>for this cauſe</hi> (that is, becauſe God hath ſo loued vs as to make vs his children) <hi>the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld knoweth you not:</hi> and becauſe we haue receiued the ſpirit of adoption, and ſhew the ſame by the fruits thereof: as (I ſay) all ſuch muſt make reckoning of trouble in the world, ſo eſpecially, the more excellent that any of Gods children are, and the greater meaſure they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the ſpirit of adoption, the more they muſt looke to be moleſted, and troubled in the world.</p>
               <p>Marke the hiſtory of the old teſtament from the beginning to the ending, and ye ſhall find, that alwaies the greateſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions did follow the beſt of Gods children: the beſt Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks: the beſt Prophets: the moſt holy men of other ſort.</p>
               <p>The like is to be ſaid of the new Teſtament. As the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had receiued greater gifts from God then other, ſo they were the more perſecuted by men then other. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of himſelfe and of the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſaith, <hi>I thinke that God hath ſet foorth vs the laſt Apoſtles, as men appointed to death: for we are made a gazing ſtocke vnto the world, and to the Angels, and to men, &amp;c. 1. Cor.</hi> 49. and again, <hi>We are made as the filth of the world, the ofſcouring of all things, &amp;c.</hi> verſe 13.</p>
               <p>This cannot but be looked for in reſpect of the world. For if the world know vs not, that is, do hate vs and enuy vs, for <hi>this cauſe,</hi> becauſe we are Gods children: then it cannot be but that the more we ſhew ourſelues to be the children of God, the more the world will hate &amp; enuy vs. Neither is any other thing to be looked for in reſpect of God himſelf. For why ſhould we think that God giueth ſome a greater meaſure of his ſpirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he giueth to other ſom? There is no more in one to win Gods loue in that behalf, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in another. For God hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen this loue to al his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alike, to be ſo called, &amp; to be
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:18428:220"/> indeed his children. It muſt therefore be in reſpect of the end for which he doth ſo: viz. that ſuch may beare the more affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and by bearing ſuch afflictions they may glorifie God the more, that hath ſo honoured them, not only aboue other men, but alſo aboue other of his children. It ſtandeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with great reaſon: for the higheſt cedars and the talleſt and greateſt okes are the more ſubiect to ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt point to be obſerued from this obiection.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point to be obſerued from the firſt part of the anſwer to the ſaid obiection, viz. from the cauſe why the world taketh ſo little notice of Gods children, &amp;c. namely becauſe they know not God himſelfe, is this, that although all the children of God muſt looke for trouble and vexation in the world, euen as if the world had neuer knowen them, yet they haue no cauſe to be offended there with, or to thinke their ſtate to be therfore the worſe, but that rather they haue good cauſe well and patiently to beare the ſame, ſith as the world knoweth not them, ſo alſo it knoweth not God himſelfe. Heereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that more plainly, which before hath beene handled more plentifully, that all the world, that is, all the wicked and vnregenerated in the world, are fooles, and little better then mad men. For how can they be wiſe, yea how can they be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then fooles, that know not him that is moſt wiſe, yea only wiſe, and that is the giuer and the only fountaine of all wiſdome?</p>
               <p>If it bee ſo, what cauſe haue the children of God any whit to diſlike their ſtate, or to thinke their dignity to be the leſſe, becauſe there is ſo little reckoning made of them by the world, that is, by the men of the world, that are all (ſo long as they doe continue of the world) no better then a brood of fooles? For what wiſe man (ſuch as all the children of God are before ſhewed to bee) will care for the ſcoffes, or ſcornes, or any other indignities offred vnto him by a foole? Yea, will not euery wiſe man thinke him to bee a foole himſelfe, that will either contend with a foole about ſuch indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as by ſuch a foole are offred vnto him; or thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the worſe in any reſpect becauſe of ſuch indignities?</p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:18428:221"/>
               <p>The moſt that can be made of the indignity which wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from the world, is that they do all that that they doe in that behalfe, of meer ignorance. Is there then any cauſe why we ſhould thereby be diſmaied, or think the worſe of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</p>
               <p>Let the world therfore and all worldings, euen all the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the world deride vs, and wrong vs that are the children of God, as they will. Let them goe with their follies. Let vs ſhew our wiſedome in not contending with them: but in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all things, and in winking at all things, as though we ſaw nothing.</p>
               <p>The greateſt noble man of a kingdome, being where he is not known, to be ſo noble, will neuer take it ill, that meane perſons paſſe by him without any ſuch reuerence as is due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch nobility. In like manner therefore ſith we heare that the world knoweth vs not, let vs the better beare all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities.</p>
               <p>By ſuch bearing their follies and wrongs, we ſhall either at the laſt win and conuert them (eſpecially if with our patience, we ſhall alſo ioine earneſt praiers for them) to be of our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and to turne the children of God as well as we: or els we ſhall make their laſt iudgement and condemnation the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: which will be reuenge enough for whatſoeuer hurt they haue done vnto vs.</p>
               <p>To the former two points, let me yet adde a third, ariſing from both the former: viz. that all that doe not know and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the children of God, do thereby be wray themſelues to be of the world; and to be ignorant of God, and ſo to haue no communion with God. This hath been proued before by thoſe Scriptures that haue been alledged for the fourth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word <hi>world,</hi> eſpecially by <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 20. and that of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 3. But I do only name this: let the reader further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the obiection, and for the firſt part of the anſwer thereunto: or for the firſt reaſon, why the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the children of God: and ſo alſo for this firſt verſe of this text.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this ſecond verſe is contained the ſecond anſwer to the former obiection, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon why the world doth ſo little regard, and ſo much hate the children of God.</p>
               <p>I grant that ſome make theſe words the only obiection, and anſwer thereto: viz. the obiection in the firſt words of the verſe, <hi>Deerly beloued now are we the children of God, but</hi> (or <hi>and) it doth not appeare what we ſhall be:</hi> and the anſwer in the words following, <hi>but we know that when he ſhall appeare, we ſhall be like him.</hi> And this they make the meaning; You tell vs that it is an exceeding dignity to be called the children of God: but (alas) what auaileth it vs, or what are we the better for ſuch titles, ſith whatſoeuer titles we haue, yet it doth not appeare what we ſhall be: no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what ſhall become of vs. Yes, ſaith the Apoſtle (according to the interpretation of ſome men) wee are not only called the children of God, neither haue we the bare titles of the children of God, but we are indeed for the preſent the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, as well as ſo called: and though it do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare what we ſhall be, yet the time ſhall come, when we ſhall be like to him.</p>
               <p>Thus (I ſay) ſome interpret theſe words: but I rather thinke them (as I ſaid before) to be a further anſwer to the former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, and to containe a ſecond reaſon, why the world ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no more reckoning of vs, viz. becauſe they do not ſee our future ſtate and condition.</p>
               <p>This anſwer and ſecond reaſon of the worlds hatred againſt the children of God, is firſt propounded in theſe words, <hi>deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued, now are we the children of God, but</hi> (or rather <hi>and) it doth not appeare what we ſhall be.</hi> Secondly it is amplified by an argument taken from diuers things, or rather the worlds ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of our future ſtate, is amplied by the contrary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:18428:222"/> thereof in our ſelues, in theſe words following, <hi>but we know that when he ſhall appeare, we ſhall be like him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To returne to the propoſition of the ſecond anſwer to the former obiection, or to the ſecond reaſon, why the world knoweth vs not, let vs firſt obſerue, that as it is a ſweet argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which now the Apoſtle handleth, viz. of Gods wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full loue in making vs his children, ſo he prefixeth a ſweet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face before this ſecond anſwer, namely, the ſweet name of <hi>Deerly beloued:</hi> which word, as it is vſuall with the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſo eſpecially it is moſt vſed by this Apoſtle, both in all this Epiſtle in euery Chapter, and alſo in the other two ſhort Epiſtles following. The reaſon why this Apoſtle more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in this louely word then the reſt, ſeemeth to be double. Firſt becauſe he was the diſciple whom Chriſt eſpecially lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and whom Chriſt vſed ſo familiarly, that he ſuffered him <hi>to leane on his breaſt,</hi> and who is therfore called <hi>the diſciple whom Ieſus loued: Ioh.</hi> 13. 23. &amp; 21. 7. that is, whom Ieſus loued in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner, and aboue the reſt. Secondly becauſe the chiefe ſubiect of all theſe three Epiſtles being loue, it was the more ſutable therunto, that he ſhould vſe the more amiable words, for the better perſwading thereof.</p>
               <p>Hereby wee learne, the more experience we haue had of Chriſts loue towards vs, the more to abound in all words, and in the affection it ſelfe of loue towards other. For we muſt not thinke, that either this Apoſtle or the reſt, vſed this word or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other the like, of cuſtome, or of courſe, or to fill vp the ſentences, and to make them the ſmoother (as it is the manner of many in theſe daies, to haue much <hi>Deerly beloued,</hi> in their mouthes, but to be without loue; yea, to be full of hatred and malice in their hearts, as <hi>Ioah</hi> with his mouth ſaid vnto <hi>Amaſa, Art thou in health my brother, but with a ſpeare in his hand he ſmote him vnder the fift rib, that hee ſhed his bowels to the ground: 2. Sam.</hi> 20. 10. and as <hi>Iudas</hi> with his lippes ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our Sauiour ſaying, <hi>Haile Maſter, and kiſſed him,</hi> and yet at the ſame inſtant betraied him to the Iewes: <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 49.) We muſt not (I ſay) thinke that the Apoſtles had much loue in their mouthes and none in their hearts (as many now haue) but that their tongues ſpake, and their pennes did write
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:18428:222"/> from the abundance of loue in their hearts.</p>
               <p>The more alſo we exhort other to loue, the more muſt we our ſelues ſhew our loue towards them; and vſe ſuch words and phraſes, as may be moſt ſutable to ſuch exhortations, for the better enforcing of them. But theſe things being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and not ſo proper to this preſent theame of the dignity of Gods children, it ſhall be ſufficient, thus only to haue tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them.</p>
               <p>To returne to the matter, as before the Apoſtle had anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the former obiection touching the ſmall account the world maketh of the children of God, by their like account of God himſelfe; yea, by their ignorance of God: ſo now he doth further anſwer it, by their like ignorance of the future ſtate of the children of God.</p>
               <p>As theſe two things are the cauſe, why the ſonnes of great men in the world in ſtrange countries meete often times with much hard meaſure, being perhaps diſgraced, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ailed on, ſet in the ſtockes, and ſuch like, viz: Firſt becauſe the parents of ſuch great men are not knowen: Secondly becauſe it is not known, what inheritances themſelues ſhall haue, nor what manner of men, of how great authority and power they ſhall be: (for if they amongſt whom they are ſtrangers knew theſe things, they would offer no indignity vnto them, but would rather honor them according to their parents, and according to that ſtate that themſelues ſhould afterward be of) ſo is it with the children of God. They are the more diſgraced, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, and euery way moſt vnworthily dealt with in the world, and by the world, as firſt becauſe the world knoweth not God himſelfe their Father (as hath been ſhewed;) ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe they know not, neither ſee, what the children of God ſhall bee afterward: viz. how great, how honourable, and how excellent with God, and with his holy Angels. If they did ſee this, doubtleſſe, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaith, <hi>that if the great workes that were done in Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razin and Bethſaida, had beene done in Tyrus and Sidon, they had repented long agone in ſackcloth and aſhes: Mat</hi> 12. 21. ſo may I ſay, that the world would more regard the children of God then they doe.</p>
               <pb n="420" facs="tcp:18428:223"/>
               <p>Now touching this anſwer, let vs vnderſtand that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh not of that ſtate that the children of God ſhall haue in this life, but of that which they ſhall haue in the life to come, as appeareth by the amplification thereof in the words following, from the contrary in the children of God, ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the circumſtance of time, viz. at the appearing of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. The meaning therefore is, <hi>Deerely beloued, now</hi> (that is, in this life, and whiles wee are heere in this world) <hi>it doth not appeare what we ſhall be,</hi> (that is, in the world to come) <hi>when hee ſhall appeare:</hi> (that is, when God himſelfe in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon, inueſted with the manhood, ſhall come in the glorie of his father to iudge the quicke and the dead.</p>
               <p>True indeed, ſometime the children of God are the leſſe regarded, and the more hardly dealt withall by the world, yea ſometimes by them that are not of the world, becauſe it doth not appeare vnto the world, and to ſome other not of the world, what the children of God ſhall bee euen in this world, and in this life.</p>
               <p>For if it had indeed appeared to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> what the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> ſhould haue beene, would they haue dealt ſo hardly with them? If <hi>Saul</hi> and his Courtiers had fully knowen that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſhould haue beene king, notwithſtanding all that they could haue done to hinder him, would they ſo haue perſecuted him? If the accuſers of <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abedneg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Daniel,</hi> had indeed knowen how the Lord would haue deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the firſt three from the fire, and <hi>Daniel</hi> from the Lions denne, would they haue purſued them ſo eagerly as they did? The like may be ſaid of <hi>Hamans</hi> malice againſt <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and for <hi>Mordecaies</hi> ſake againſt all the Iewes, and of diuers other. So alſo if the brethren of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had certainly knowen that his dreames had beene diuine touching his aduancement, and that he ſhould haue beene ſo great a man as afterward he was, would they haue done vnto him as they did?</p>
               <p>Yea the like may be ſaid of our late moſt noble and bleſſed Queene. For if in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time it had appeared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and beene cleerely man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>feſt, that ſhe ſhould haue beene Queene afterward, would diuers haue abuſed her as they did? I might proceed further: but I leaue that to the conſideration
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:18428:223"/> of the wiſe and Chriſtian Reader. By theſe things wee ſee it euident, that ſometimes it doth not appeare vnto other what the children of God ſhall bee euen in this world, and in this life, and that therefore they receiue the harder meaſure from thoſe other, from whom their future ſtate in this life is ſo hidden. Notwithſtanding the oppoſition following of Gods childrens knowledge of their ſimilitude and likeneſſe vnto Chriſt at his appearing and laſt comming to iudgement, doth manifeſtly ſhew that the Apoſtle doth not heere ſpeake of their condition to come in this life, which is for the moſt part but of a few; but of that which ſhall be in the world to come, which is a thing common to all the children of God whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.</p>
               <p>To proceed further, when hee ſaith, <hi>it doth not appeare,</hi> hee meaneth not to the children of God themſelues, but to the world, and to the men of the world. This is alſo manifeſt by the oppoſition following ſpoken in the firſt perſon, and in the perſon of Gods children: <hi>But we know,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus opened, let vs now ſee the reaſons why it appeareth not vnto the world, and why the world ſeeth not what the children of God ſhall be: viz. how worthy, how honourable, how excellent, and how glorious in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons are many: but I will briefly and plainly lay them downe.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, becauſe there is the ſame ſubſtance (by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation) <note place="margin">Reaſons why it doth not appeare what the children of God ſhall bee.</note> of the godly that there is of the wicked. Howſoeuer by regeneration there is a change made, and an alteration in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities both inward and outward, yet ſtill they remaine men as before they did; and that not touching their bodies only, but alſo touching their ſoules. Some indeed haue dreamed that the very eſſence and ſubſtance of the ſoule in regeneration is taken away, and that a new ſoule is created in ſtead thereof. But this is a moſt groſſe errour: for ſo that ſoule that had at the firſt ſinned, ſhould not be glorified; and ſo the heretikes that denie the reſurrection, and ſay that we ſhall not haue the ſame bodies in the reſurrection that heere we haue, but other newly created in their ſtead, may bee thought to ſpeake alſo
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:18428:224"/> reaſon. It is therfore as certain that the ſame ſoules do remaine in the children of God after regeneration, as well as the ſame bodies.</p>
               <p>Yea the wicked doe alſo ſee the godly to retaine the ſame ſhape, the ſame faſhion, the ſame outward forme, and the ſame countenance that they had before regeneration, and whiles they were vngodly, as well as others. It may bee indeed, that after regeneration of the heart there is alſo ſome change in the countenance and outward behauiour: and ſo verily it ought to be in men and in women. For <hi>Wiſdome is in the face of him that hath vnderſtanding: but the eies of a foole are in the corners of the world: Prou.</hi> 17. 24. And thoſe men that before regeneration had light countenances, wanton and adulterous eies, and did either weare long haire contrary to the decencie of nature, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. or that otherwiſe did disfigure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by ſetting vp a foretop, ſtarching their beards, and ſuch like, after regeneration doe frame countenance, haire, and all things to manly and Chriſtian modeſty and grauity. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe women that before did paint their faces as <hi>lezabel,</hi> or that did lay foorth or ſet vp their haire (top and top gallant) or wreath it in moſt vncomely ſort, that did likewiſe lay forth their naked breſts in moſt laſciuious manner, that did weare mans apparell, doublets and ierkins (as mine owne eies haue lately ſeene) directly contrary to the word of God (as hath beene before ſhewed) and that did euery way conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to thoſe wanton wenches who are by the Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>to walke with ſtreched out necks, and with wandring eies, walking and mineing as they went, and making a tinkling with their feet,</hi> and whoſe ornaments the Lord doth threaten to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. 16. &amp;c. Such women (I ſay) being new borne, and made daughters to God, doe change their countenance, attire, and gate, co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tenting themſelues with that natural beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which God hath giuen them, and which will not fall off with the ſteame of hot broth, yea which need not daily bee renued, and <hi>arraying themſelues in comely apparell, with ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe, and modeſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and with good workes: 1. Tim.</hi> 2. 9 10 But howſoeuer there bee a change in theſe things, yet the wicked ſeeing the godly ſtill to be of the ſame complexion and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:18428:224"/> countenance that they were of, they are therfore the blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in ſeeing that great and glorious change that afterward ſhall be in them, and whereof afterward we are to ſpeake.</p>
               <p>Secondly, foraſmuch as they ſee the godly to be ſubiect to the ſame ſickneſſes, and to the ſame other outward calamities that themſelues are ſubiect vnto, yea that many times the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the righteous are greater then of other men, <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 21. 6. Pſal.</hi> 34. 19. (as before wee haue declared, with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences notwithſtanding betwixt the afflictions of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and of the children of God) therefore alſo they can the leſſe ſee, and they are the more hardly perſwaded, that there is any difference betwixt the future ſtate of them and of other men. Yea this maketh the children of God themſelues many times to doubt of their future ſtate, and to ſay, yea in a maner to conclude with themſelues in their owne hearts, (for a time, till they goe into the Sanctuarie of God, and conſult with God himſelfe, and with his word) <hi>that certainly they haue clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their hearts in vaine, and waſhed their hands in innocencie, ſith they are daily puniſhed, and chaſtened euery morning. Dauid</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had theſe thoughts, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 73. 13. 14. long after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. No maruell therefore though the wicked bee ſo blinded, that it doth not appeare vnto them <hi>what the children of God ſhall be</hi> in the life to come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they doe not onely ſee the children of God for a time to bee thus ſubiect to the ſame outward afflictions that other are ſubiect vnto, but alſo ſometime that ſuch afflictions doe continue all the daies that the children of God doe liue heere; yea, that at the laſt alſo they die oft times the common death of men; yea, that they are taken away alſo in the ſame manner, and doe periſh in the ſame ſort that the wicked them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues doe periſh, viz. touching their outward man, and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching outward appearance; yea, that ſometimes (as touching ſtill their outward man) they periſh ſomwhat extraordinarily, and are taken away ſomewhat ſuddenly and ſtrangely as well as the wicked.</p>
               <p>As rebellious <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinebas</hi> were ſlaine in one day by the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> according to the word of the Lord in that behalfe, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 34. ſo their good father <hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> himſelfe alſo
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:18428:225"/> when he heard thereof, and of the taking of the Arke of God, fell backward from his ſeat, <hi>and brake his neck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, 1 Sam.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
               <p>As wicked <hi>Saul</hi> was hit and ſore wounded by the Archers of the ſaid vncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> and therefore fell vpon his owne ſword, and thereby haſtned his owne death; ſo good and vertuous <hi>Ionathan</hi> alſo was ſlaine in the ſame battle: 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 2. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Prophet, that being deceiued by another old Prophet, did contrary to the word of God before ſpoken vnto him, in his returne homeward was killed by a Lion: 1. <hi>King.</hi> 13. 24.</p>
               <p>That moſt worthy King <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> who hath this high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation by the ſpirit of God that cannot lie: <hi>(Like vnto him there was no King before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his ſoule, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moſes; neither after him aroſe there any like him: 2. King.</hi> 23. 25.) euen this moſt worthy King was ſlaine by <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao Necho</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> verſe 29. that is, he was ſo wounded, that hee was carried away ſicke out of the battle, and died of that wound: 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 23. &amp;c. and that becauſe hee would fight againſt the ſaid <hi>Pharao Necho,</hi> though by him hee were aduiſed to the contrarie.</p>
               <p>So for ſome abuſe in the Supper of the Lord, it is ſaid, not only that <hi>many</hi> in the Church of Corinth <hi>were weake and ſicke,</hi> but that alſo <hi>many were aſleepe, 1. Cor.</hi> 11. 30. that is, that the Lord had taken many of them away by death.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being ſo as well with the children of God as with the wicked, is it any maruell though <hi>it doe not appeare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wicked what the children of God ſhall be heereafter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the children of God are neuer freed heere from ſinne. Sinne indeed doth not raigne in them. They are freed from the bondage of it: yet ſtill they are ſubiect to ſinne of infirmitie, as before we haue heard: yea they ſometimes fall into one and the ſame ſinne often: yea they doe ſometimes commit very great ſins, euen ſuch as whereby they doe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſcandalize and offend other, and cauſe the glorious name of God to be euill ſpoken of. Such was the great ſinne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and againſt her husband <hi>Vrija:</hi> ſuch was the ſinne of <hi>Peter</hi> in denying his Lord and maſter with ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:18428:225"/> and curſing: and ſuch offenſes there are daily in the Church: yea ſometimes the children of God doe lie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long in many ſinnes, almoſt in all ſinnes, euen after their regeneration, as <hi>Salomon</hi> did.</p>
               <p>By theſe things their owne future ſtate is obſcured, eclipſed, and hidden from themſelues. It doth not appeare to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues what they ſhall be. God hideth his face from them, and they are ſore troubled, as if they were reprobates, and thinking themſelues to be reprobates: yea ſo by ſuch things are their good mindes tormented, that they cannot endure their ſaid torments, but ſeeke in their weakneſſe, and in the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of their tentation, to make themſelues away, and to ſhorten their owne daies. Foraſmuch therefore as by this meanes it doth not for the preſent appeare to the children of God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues what they ſhall bee, wee may well conclude, that much leſſe it doth appeare to the wicked.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, many that haue ſeemed to haue beene new borne as well as any other, and to haue receiued as plentifull a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit of adoption as any other, or at the leaſt as many other that were indeed the children of God: many ſuch (I ſay) haue wholly and finally fallen away from the grace of God: and that hath been vtterly taken away from them which they ſeemed to haue had; yea thoſe common graces alſo of Gods ſpirit which indeed they had.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Saul</hi> was amongſt the Prophets, who would not haue thought him to haue beene one of Gods children?</p>
               <p>When <hi>Iehu</hi> was ſo forward and zealous for God, and did ſo great things commanded him by the Lord, who would not haue thought him to haue beene one of Gods children?</p>
               <p>When <hi>Iudas</hi> was amongſt the Apoſtles, and receiued the ſame commiſſion and power to preach and to worke miracles that the reſt did, who would not haue thought him to haue beene one of Gods children?</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of thoſe of whom wee haue heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of <hi>Ioh. 6. 66. Heb.</hi> 10. 25. and of diuers other.</p>
               <p>Now although ſuch indeed were neuer <hi>of vs, for if they had beene of vs, they would not</hi> (neither could) <hi>haue gone from vs, but would haue continued with vs: 1. Ioh.</hi> 2. 19. yet the wicked ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:18428:226"/> ſuch, doe preſently ſay, that all are alike; there is no bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell better herring: and therfore they peremptorily conclude, that the end of all ſhall be like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> himſelfe iudging according only to naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo iudged, and ſaid, <hi>All things come alike to all; and the ſame condition is to the iuſt and to the wicked, to the good, and to the pure, and to the polluted, and to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not: as is the good, ſo is the ſinner; he that ſweareth, and he that feareth an oath: Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 2. Yea, according to the ſame naturall iudgement, hee had ſaid before, <hi>I conſidered in mine heart the ſtate of the children of men, that God had purged them; yet to ſee to they are in themſelues as beaſts: for the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the children of men, and the condition of beaſts, are euen as one condition vnto them. As the one dieth, ſo dieth the other: for they haue all one breath, and there is no excellencie of man aboue the beaſts, for all is vanitie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 18. 19. If <hi>Salomon</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mans reaſon ſo iudged, is it any maruell that they that neuer had that ſpirit that <hi>Salomon</hi> had, doe iudge in like manner, and that <hi>vnto them it doth not appeare what the children of God ſhall be?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe things together make a thicke cloud of reaſons, ſuch as doe ſo hoodwinke and blindfold the wicked, that euen at noone day they cannot ſee what the children of God ſhall bee.</p>
               <p>And all theſe are externall cauſes to the wicked of the not appearance vnto them of the future ſtate of Gods children: ſuch cauſes (I ſay) as are rather in the children of God, then in the wicked.</p>
               <p>Now beſides theſe, there are alſo other lets and impediments of the foreſaid not appearance of the future condition of Gods children, euen in the wicked themſelues: and theſe are three: one without them, yet theirs, and inueſted as it were in them; and the other two within them.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe (and the ſixth in the whole number) is their owne great proſperitie and flouriſhing ſtate in outward things. For by this meanes the wicked <hi>bleſſeth himſelfe, that he thinketh there is no God:</hi> and therefore as the iudgements of God againſt himſelfe <hi>are high aboue his ſight, Pſal.</hi> 10. 3. 4. &amp;c.
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:18428:226"/> ſo hee ſaith, <hi>It is in vaine to ſerue God: and what profit is it that wee haue kept his Commandements, and that wee walked humbly before the Lord of hoſts?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Malac. 3. 14. Iob</hi> 21. 15. As they doe thus ſpeake of their owne hypocriticall ſeruing of God, that there is no reward of it, (as in truth there is not;) ſo they iudge the like of the children of God. How therfore can they ſee what heereafter they ſhall be?</p>
               <p>Secondly, (I meane for this ſecond ſort of reaſons, but ſeuenthly for the whole) the generall ſpirituall blindneſſe that is in all the wicked, doth alſo hinder them, that they cannot ſee what the children of God ſhall bee. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true knowledge there can bee no iudgement in them to diſcerne things that differ, belonging to their owne ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 9. 10. How then can they ſee the things that belong to the ſaluation of other? Much leſſe therefore can they ſee the ſaluation it ſelfe of other.</p>
               <p>As the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in generall of all <hi>the things of the ſpirit of God, that the naturall man perceiueth them not, neither can know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned: 1. Cor.</hi> 2. 14. ſo it may bee ſaid of this particular, that it cannot bee diſcerned by naturall men. For it is a ſpirituall thing as well as other. Hee that hath not eies to ſee any thing for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, how ſhall hee ſee any thing for another man? Hee that cannot ſee things preſent, how ſhall hee ſee things to come?</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, and moſt principally, it doth not appeare vnto the wicked what the children of God ſhall bee, not onely becauſe of their ſpirituall blindneſſe, but alſo bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſpirituall hardneſſe of their hearts, and of that great infidelitie and vnbeleefe that is in them. For theſe goe together, and are therefore ioined together, <hi>the cogitation darkened, ignorance and hardneſſe of heart: Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour ſaith to <hi>Martha, Said I not vnto thee, that if thou didſt beleeue thou ſhouldeſt ſee the glorie of God? Ioh.</hi> 11. 40.</p>
               <p>If this might bee ſaid to <hi>Martha</hi> her ſelfe, that beleeued the generall reſurrection of all fleſh, (as ſhee had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:18428:227"/> in verſe 24.) becauſe her faith was weake in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of raiſing vp her brother preſently, how much more may it it bee ſaid to them and of them that doe not beleeue at all?</p>
               <p>As the want of faith hindreth vs from ſeeing the glory of God, ſo alſo it hindreth from ſeeing the glory of his children, and any ſpeciall worke of God towards them, for which hee may be glorified by them.</p>
               <p>As our Sauiour ſignifieth, that the weakneſſe of her faith might hinder her from ſeeing the preſent reſurrection of her brother <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and ſo conſequently from the ſight of the glorie of God which therein ſhould bee ſhewed: ſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee but that the nullitie of faith in the wicked muſt much more hinder them from ſeeing the glorie of the Saints at the laſt day, and in the kingdome of Heauen.</p>
               <p>The vnbeleefe of men did ſometimes hinder Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from doing thoſe workes which otherwiſe hee would haue done, and whereby hee would haue ſhewed his owne glorie, and the glorie of his father: <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 58. Yea it is ſaid, that in ſome places <hi>hee could doe no great workes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the maruellous vnbeleefe of them that</hi> dwelt in ſuch places: <hi>Marke</hi> 6. 5. 6. If vnbeleefe did ſo hinder Chriſt, that hee did not, neither could doe any great workes for the bodily good of men, doth not vnbeleefe much more hinder men from the ſight of the euerlaſting ſaluation of his elect, for which they ſhall giue glory vnto God, and vnto the Lambe for euermore?</p>
               <p>By this vnbeleefe it hath come to paſſe that mens eies haue beene ſhut vp in ſuch ſort, that they haue not ſeene the ſaluation of the children of God from many dangers of this life, how apparant and manifeſt ſoeuer the ſame haue beene. Conſider the vniuerſall flood, and behold the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold manifeſt tokens, both thereof, and alſo of the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of all that beleeuing the ſame ſhould either haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to <hi>Noah</hi> to goe with him into the Arke which hee had made, or by true repentance haue preuented it. <hi>Noah</hi> with many other buſied themſelues for the ſpace of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty yeeres in building the Arke. When the
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:18428:227"/> time of the flood it ſelfe approched, he prouided all things fit for preſeruation of himſelfe, and of his companie, and of all other creatures that ſhould reſort vnto him to bee preſerued by him. Who would not by theſe things haue thought that there had beene ſome great worke of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards? Who would not haue ſeene the purpoſe of God for the glorious preſeruation of all thoſe that ſhould beleeue the preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> and doe accordingly? Yet behold more. When the time of the flood approched neerer, all creatures, as well wilde as tame, as well fierce as gentle, as well flying fowles as foure footed beaſts, came to <hi>Noah,</hi> and offred themſelues to bee put into the Arke: Wolues, Beares, Tigres, Elephants, Lions, Hawkes of all ſorts, Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, and ſuch like: All theſe (I ſay) came by the ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God for their ſo comming. No man did fetch them: No man did call them: No man did driue them: No man vſed any art to gather them together. Who would not haue wondred at this? Who would not haue thought all the former preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> touching the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world by the flood, to haue beene true? Who would not haue beleeued it? Who would not haue beene perſwaded of it? Who would not haue ſeene the future ſaluation of <hi>Noah</hi> and his familie in the Arke? Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, though they had ſeene what <hi>Noah</hi> had beene, yet it did not appeare vnto them what hee and his ſhould bee, as touching their ſafetie from that great iudgement, which hee ſo long had preached. This is the more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, becauſe thoſe creatures which then came ſo willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, neither before could, nor ſithence can, either without much force, or without great art and skill, be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſubiection.</p>
               <p>The like may bee ſaid of the deliuerance of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Who would not haue thought, and ſeene by all the miracles that the Lord did in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> euen before the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> by the turning of <hi>Moſes</hi> his rodde into a ſerpent; by the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of all the waters in <hi>Egypt</hi> into blood, ſo that all the fiſh that was in the ſame water died, and ſtanke, <hi>Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Who (I ſay) by theſe things would not haue thought and ſeene what the Iſraelites ſhould bee, and how great ſaluation the Lord had prepared for them? Come wee a little further to the comming of the Iſraelites to the red ſea: when the Lord made the waters to ſtand vpon heapes, and to be as a wall of each ſide of them, what could bee more euident, then that the Lord would both ſaue <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and alſo deſtroy the <hi>Egyptians?</hi> A man would thinke that theſe two things (the ſaluation (I ſay) of the Iſraelites, and the ouerthrow of the Egyptians) by all the former things had beene as plaine as the noſe (as men vſe to ſpeake) of a mans face. Yet for all this, ſo were the Egyptians blinded, ſo were their hearts through infidelitie and vnbeleefe hardened, that it did not appeare vnto them, how either the Iſraelites ſhould be ſaued, or themſelues deſtroied.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of the great miracles that our Sauiour wrought heere vpon the earth; as alſo of the great ſignes that were done at the putting of him to death: viz. of the renting of the veile of the Temple, of the generall darkneſſe vpon the whole Land from the ſixth houre to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ninth, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and appearing of many of the Saints that ſlept. For who would not haue thought, but that by all theſe things it ſhould haue appeared what Chriſt was, and what hee ſhould bee? Yet ſuch was their extreme infidelitie and vnbeleefe, that for all that they could not ſee thoſe things which were ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: viz. neither what Chriſt was, nor eſpecially what Chriſt ſhould be.</p>
               <p>The ſame is to bee ſaid of thoſe things whereby God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:18428:228"/> plainly what <hi>Steuen</hi> ſhould bee: eſpecially that <hi>the whole Councell did behold his face as the face of an Angell of God: Act.</hi> 6. 15. Who would not haue thought but that they ſhould haue ſeene thereby in what grace and fauour hee was with God, and what glorie hee ſhould haue likewiſe before God? Yet when hee ſaid, <hi>Behold I ſee the heauens open, and the ſonne of man ſtanding at the right hand of God,</hi> they were ſo farre from ſeeing any ſuch thing, that <hi>they ſhouted with a loud voice, and ſtopped their eares, and ran vpon him all at once, and caſt him out of the citie, and ſtoned him: Act.</hi> 7. 56. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I might to the former adde the daily moſt wonderfull workes of Gods gracious prouidence for the true profeſſors of the Goſpell in theſe laſt daies: as the vpholding of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> many yeeres in deſpight of all his moſt mighty aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: the often and moſt miraculous preſeruation of our late moſt bleſſed Queene, and of this whole kingdome, both from many moſt dangerous and ſecret conſpiracies of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Traitors at home, and alſo from the great intended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſion of the Spaniards abroad: together with the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance of our preſent dread Soueraigne, as from many former treaſons in SCOTLAND, ſo alſo from many other ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence his aduancement heere: and eſpecially that more then wonderfull preſeruation of his Maieſtie, and of all his royall ſeede, and of the whole ſtate of the Land, from the moſt diuelliſh plot of the powder treaſon heere at home. I might further remember the great preſeruation of little <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi> being ſo often aſſaulted by many moſt mightie aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: and the gratious prouiſion that God did make for <hi>Rochel</hi> in the great diſtreſſe thereof by a long and tedious, and no leſſe lamentable ſiege. I might with theſe things ioine many fearefull iudgements of God, not onely vpon many particular Papiſts that haue beene moſt malicious againſt the truth and profeſſours thereof; but alſo againſt their Lord and maſter Antichriſt himſelfe (I meane the Pope) in confounding all his deuices from time to time, and in turning all his curſes into bleſſings: and bleſſing vs ſo much the more, the more that hee hath curſed vs: and likewiſe the mighty ouerthrow of his mightie nauie ſent againſt vs:
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:18428:229"/> I might (I ſay) very fitly heere remember all theſe things, and many other the like, as very pertinent to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For were not the Papiſts by Gods moſt righteous iudgement exceedingly blinded in their mindes, and as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hardened in their hearts, and fully poſſeſſed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie and vnbeleefe, they could not but ſee the truth of our religion, and the future glory and happineſſe of all them that doe truly embrace and profeſſe the ſame. But becauſe of their ſaid blindneſſe, hardneſſe, and infidelitie, it is, that how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſoeuer theſe things are in themſelues, and to any that haue any ſight, and the leaſt meaſure of faith, yet they are hidden from them, and to them it doth not appeare, either what our religion is, or what all the true-hearted profeſſours thereof ſhall be.</p>
               <p>But howſoeuer I might adde, &amp; largely handle theſe things, yet hauing beene ſo plentifull in the premiſes, and ſomewhat yet remaining, it ſhall be ſufficient thus onely to haue named them. And this ſhall be enough for the reaſons why notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we be now already the children of God, yet it doth not appeare (eſpecially to the world) what heereafter wee ſhall be. And this is the ſecond reaſon alſo why the world taketh ſo little knowledge of vs, and doth ſo little reſpect vs, yea why they doe ſo much hate and deſpiſe vs. As the like is often the cauſe (as before I ſaid) why great perſons are not regarded by ſome, becauſe theſe ſome doe not ſee that future greatneſſe of ſuch perſons: for then they would honour them, and ſeeke their fauour, in hope of ſome benefit by them: ſo is it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the children of God.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this point briefly and in one word is, that <hi>wee iudge not</hi> (either perſons or things) <hi>according to the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: but that we iudge righteous iudgement.</hi> This our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our expreſly commandeth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 24. And to iudge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to outward appearance is reprooued by God himſelfe in <hi>Samuel:</hi> for when <hi>Samuel</hi> was ſent to anoint one of <hi>Iſhai</hi> his ſonnes for King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after <hi>Saul,</hi> and when he ſaw <hi>Eliab</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iſhai</hi> before him, hee iudging according to the talneſſe of his perſon, and goodlineſſe of his countenance, (it may bee becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> whom by
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:18428:229"/> the commandement of the Lord he had anointed, <hi>was higher then any of the people from the ſhoulders vpward: 1. Sam.</hi> 10. 23.) <hi>Samuel</hi> (I ſay) iudging <hi>Eliab</hi> according to his goodly perſon and countenance, ſaid, <hi>Surely the Lords anointed is before mee.</hi> But what ſaid the Lord? <hi>Looke not on his countenance, nor on the height of his ſtature, becauſe I haue refuſed him: for God ſeeth not as man ſeeth: for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord beholdeth the heart: 1. Sam.</hi> 16. 7.</p>
               <p>Wee iudge not our coines, nor many other things, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their outward appearance, nor according to that that for the preſent they are eſteemed by ſome ignorant perſons: but we trie them by the touch ſtone, and we eſteeme of them according to that which afterward they will bee. Therefore when there is any baſe money in any kingdome allowed, and proclaimed for currant money, no man laieth or hoordeth it vp, but euery man laieth it out as faſt as he receiueth it. Why? Becauſe he daily feareth a fall. He eſteemeth it not according to that that it is, but according to that that it may be.</p>
               <p>The like wee doe with cloth, both linnen and woollen. For wee eſteeme not of the one or of the other according to the preſent gloſſe and appearance (for many times by the ſlick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, or preſſing iron, or by other cunning meanes, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare better then they are) but we iudge and eſteeme of them and giue for them according to their future proofe, and (as neere as wee can) according to that which afterward they will bee.</p>
               <p>The ſame we doe with many other things. Shall wee then bee ſo fooliſh in our iudgement of the children of God, as to account of them only according to that which preſently they appeare to be?</p>
               <p>Thus much of this ſecond anſwer briefly propounded tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the former obiection: or of the ſecond anſwer why the world knoweth not the children of God: viz. becauſe that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they bee not only in name called, but are alſo indeed the children of God, <hi>yet it doth not appeare</hi> (eſpecially to the world, and to men vnregenerate) <hi>what they ſhall be.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of that which the children of God ſhall be, viz. of their future ſimilitude and likeneſſe vnto Chriſt, and of the certaintie thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T followeth in the text, <hi>But we know that when he ſhall appeare, we ſhall be like him, &amp;c.</hi> The firſt word here, in moſt of our Engliſh Bibles is ill tranſlated <hi>and:</hi> becauſe thereby the oppoſition of theſe words to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is much obſcured. It is in the originall <hi>but:</hi> which plainly noteth the oppoſition, and teacheth the iudgement and knowledge of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to be contrary to the iudgement and knowledge of the world. This might be amplified, but that it is not a thing very pertinent to the maine point in hand of the dignity of Gods children.</p>
               <p>In all the words following let vs obſerue, firſt the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our future ſtate, or of the future ſtate of the children of God, which is, that they ſhall be like to Chriſt himſelfe: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly the further handling thereof.</p>
               <p>The propoſition is this, <hi>We knew that when hee ſhall appeare we ſhall be like him.</hi> The further handling thereof is in the words following.</p>
               <p>In the propoſition let vs obſerue, firſt the future ſtate itſelfe of Gods children. Secondly the arguments wherby in the very propoſition it is ſet forth.</p>
               <p>The future ſtate it ſelfe of Gods children is, that <hi>they ſhall be like to Chriſt himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The arguments wherby this is ſet forth in the very propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, or which are folded vp and included within the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, are two. The firſt is from their owne teſtimony, noting the certainty of their ſimilitude vnto Chriſt, <hi>we know.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is from the circumſtance of time when they ſhall be like him, <hi>when he ſhall appeare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in theſe words, <hi>but we know that when he ſhall appeare, wee ſhall be like him,</hi> to ſpeake plainly, without any words of logick,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:18428:230"/> and to the capacity of euery reader, there are three things of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to our conſideration: firſt (not in the order of the text, but in the nature of the things) our future ſimilitude and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to Chriſt, in theſe words <hi>we ſhall be like him:</hi> Secondly the certainty of our ſaid future ſimilitude, and likeneſſe to Chriſt in this word <hi>we know:</hi> thirdly the time when we ſhall be like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, in theſe words, <hi>when he ſhall appeare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the further handling of the ſaid propoſition, firſt the latter part thereof, namely both their ſimilitude or likeneſſe to Chriſt, and the time thereof, is proued by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the effect in this verſe, and in theſe words: <hi>For,</hi> or <hi>becauſe we ſhall ſee him as he is:</hi> ſecondly the firſt part of the ſaid propoſition, touching their owne teſtimony, and their knowledge and certaintie of their ſimilitude and likeneſſe vnto Chriſt at his comming, is amplified by an effect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thereof in the third verſe, and in theſe words; <hi>Euerie one that hath this hope in him purgeth himſelfe:</hi> which is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amplified by the patterne, according to which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himſelfe, in theſe words, <hi>as he is pure.</hi> Thus much for the logicall reſolution and plaine laying foorth of all the words now remaining.</p>
               <p>To returne now to our ſimilitude and likeneſſe vnto Chriſt, let this be firſt obſerued, that the Apoſtle ſaith not we ſhall be equall, but only like vnto Chriſt. The words equall and like do much differ. The firſt is vſed <hi>Mat. 20. 12. Theſe last haue labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but one houre, &amp; thou haſt made them equall vnto vs, that haue borne the weight and the heat of the day.</hi> But the word (like) in this place is far otherwiſe, and is vſed <hi>Mat. 11. 16. Whereunto ſhall I liken this generation? It is like to little children, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places. Equality is not only a word of quantity for the moſt part, but alſo when it is a note of quality, it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of all things, wherein the things compared doe fully match one another: but ſimilitude, is only a compariſon of ſome things, wherein the things compared do but in part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble one another.</p>
               <p>There is no reaſon, why the children of God ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to Chriſt: becauſe Chriſt is the head, and they are but the members: Chriſt is the eldeſt brother, they but the ſecond
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:18428:231"/> brethren: Chriſt is the proper and naturall ſonne of God, by communication of the whole diuine eſſence vnto him as he is God; and by the perſonall vnion of the Godhead to the manhood, and the miraculous and immediat conception of him by the holy Ghoſt as he is man: (as before hath beene ſhewed) but we (of whom here the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) are but the children of God by grace, by adoption, and by incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration into Chriſt, &amp;c. Chriſt is <hi>annointed with the oyle of gladneſſe,</hi> with the ſpirit of <hi>wiſedome, knowledge, fortitude, &amp;c.</hi> without meaſure: ſo that in <hi>him are hid all the treaſures of wiſedome, and knowledge, and the Godhead alſo dwelleth in him bodily;</hi> that is, ſubſtantially: but we haue euery one receiued the ſpirit of God in our ſeuerall meaſure, according to our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall places: and Gods ſpirit dwelleth in vs, by the effects therof, euen ſuch graces, whereby we doe here repreſent God, and are ſaid to be framed according to the likeneſſe and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of God <hi>in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt is the King of his Church, and the lord of all things: we are but his ſubiects: though in an higher degree of honor then the reſt.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is the chief corner ſtone, we the reſt of the building, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As by theſe things and other the like, we ſee that there is no reaſon why we ſhould be equall to Chriſt: ſo by many other things we may ſee greater reaſon; yea diuers reaſons, why we ſhould be partaker of this ſimilitude and likeneſſe vnto Chriſt whereof the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, let vs well conſider why the Apoſtle here ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the future tence, and ſaith, <hi>that we ſhall be like vnto him.</hi> For ſome man may ſtumble at this phraſe, as gathering thereby that in this life the children of God are not like vnto Chriſt. But to remoue this ſtumbling block, we muſt vnderſtand, firſt that there is a double likenes vnto Chriſt; one in grace, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in glory. Secondly, that our likeneſſe vnto Chriſt in grace is alſo two fold: one in part, another in perfection; complete, and abſolute. In grace we are in part like vnto Chriſt in this life. But our likeneſſe vnto Chriſt both perfectly in grace, and alſo in glory, is only in the life to come. He that is not in grace like vnto Chriſt here in part in this life; that is, he
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:18428:231"/> that is not begun heere to bee made like vnto Chriſt in grace, ſhall neuer be like him in the world to come, either perfectly in grace, or in glory. Of this our likeneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnto Chriſt, both in perfection of grace, and alſo in glory is it, that here the Apoſtle vſeth the future tence, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that we ſhall be like vnto him.</hi> And this phraſe of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture likeneſſe vnto Chriſt in perfection of grace and in glory, is ſo far from excluding or denying our preſent likeneſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in grace begun and in part, that it doth rather ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily import the ſame, as both more largely before we haue already ſhewed, and ſhall againe further ſhew in the next verſe.</p>
               <p>Now to returne to this our future ſimilitude and likeneſſe vnto Chriſt, euen ſome of thoſe things before mentioned to proue the inequality betwixt Chriſt and vs, do alſo require this ſimilitude and likenes vnto him.</p>
               <p>For as it is not meet that the members ſhould be equall to the head in al things; ſo it is very meet, that they ſhould be like in many things: both of the ſame ſubſtance with the head (otherwiſe if the head be of one ſubſtance and nature, and the members of another (like to the image that <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> ſaw in his dreame: <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 32.) it were a monſter) and alſo in qualities that they may be ſomewhat ſutable, and anſwerable to their head.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of the eldeſt brother, and of the ſecond brethren: ſo of a king and his ſubiects: ſo of the chiefe corner ſtone, and of the other ſtones in the building.</p>
               <p>As for other reaſons of this our ſimilitude and likenes vnto Chriſt, they are alſo many. Chriſt is the firſt fruits: we the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Should not the firſt fruits, and the other fruits be like?</p>
               <p>Chriſt is the vine, we are the branches. Are not the branches like to the vine? Chriſt is our husband; we are his ſpouſe and wife. Is it not fit that the ſpouſe and wife ſhould be ſomewhat ſutable and anſwerable to her husband? Otherwiſe certainly they will not draw well together in one yoke.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, as Chriſt was made like vnto vs in all things (ſinne only excepted) ſo is it meet we ſhould in ſome things be made like vnto him.</p>
               <pb n="438" facs="tcp:18428:232"/>
               <p>As Chriſt was made baſe by taking vpon him the forme of a ſeruant for vs, and in this reſpect was made like vnto vs in our baſeneſſe; ſo it is meet that wee ſhould bee made by him like vnto him in glorie: yea this is iuſt and righteous, becauſe Chriſt by his baſeneſſe, and by thoſe things which he did and ſuffred for vs in his baſeneſſe, did purchaſe this our likeneſſe to himſelfe in dignity and glory. If hee therefore haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed it for vs, and giuen the full price therof in our behalfe, how can it be denied vnto vs?</p>
               <p>As in this world wee are made like vnto Chriſt in ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, reproches, and ſuffring of other indignities: ſo in the world to come we ſhall be made like vnto him in glory: <hi>Rom. 8. 17. 2. Tim.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>This ſimilitude and likeneſſe is in ſoule and in body: In ſoule, firſt, in the perfection of the knowledge of God in the three perſons, <hi>Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt:</hi> ſecondly, in the perfection of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. Notwithſtanding this holineſſe and righteouſneſſe is not only of the ſoule and inner man, but alſo of the body and outward man, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wee ſhall heare in the next verſe, yea as wee haue heard before.</p>
               <p>Of this ſimilitude of ſoule touching knowledge, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. viz. firſt of it in this life, verſe 9. <hi>We know in part, and we prophecie in part:</hi> and ſecondly both of that and of the other which ſhall be in the life to come: <hi>Now we ſee thorow a glaſſe darkly: but then wee ſhall ſee face to face. Now I know in part: but then ſhall I know euen as I am knowen.</hi> By the ſame place alſo may be gathered our ſimilitude to Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, inaſmuch as by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing in that place loue (which is the perfection of the law) from faith and hope, hee ſeemeth to inſinuate that our faith and hope ſhall in the reſurrection haue an end, but that our loue ſhall continue, and that therefore in this reſpect our loue is greater then either faith or hope.</p>
               <p>Of our inward ſimilitude and likeneſſe vnto Chriſt (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both of our inward &amp; outward likenes) in all holines and righteouſneſſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, ſaying, <hi>If wee be grafted with him to the ſimilitude of his death, euen ſo wee ſhall be to the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:18428:232"/> of his reſurrection: Rom.</hi> 6. 5.</p>
               <p>Of our likeneſſe vnto Chriſt in our bodies, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh briefly: <hi>Philip</hi> 3. 21. where he ſaith, that Chriſt <hi>ſhall change our vile bodies</hi> (vile here by ſinne, by the naturall frailty thereof, and by the manifold calamities whereto it is ſubiect by ſinne) <hi>and make it like to his glorious body, &amp;c.</hi> and more largely he ſpeaketh of it: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42. where moſt excellently he lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it forth by comparing the ſeuerall points of the likenes of our bodies to the body of Chriſt, by oppoſition of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary properties of our bodies in this life therunto. <hi>It is ſowen</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in corruption, it is raiſed in incorruption. It is ſowen in diſhonor, it is raiſed in glory. It is ſowen in weakneſſe, it is raiſed in power. It is ſowen a naturall body, it is raiſed a ſpirituall body.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he proceedeth by ſimilitude ſaying, <hi>The firſt man is of the earth, earthly: the ſecond man is the Lord from heauen. As is the earthly, ſuch are they that are earthly: as is the heauenly ſuch are they that are heauenly:</hi> verſe 47. 48. Then he concludeth this point, <hi>As we haue borne the image of the earthly, ſo ſhall we beare the image of the heauenly:</hi> verſe 49. And afterward againe, <hi>This corruptible muſt put on incorruption, and this mortall muſt put on immortalitie:</hi> verſe 53. So then, this is the likeneſſe of our body hereafter to the body of Chriſt, that as Chriſts body is now <hi>incorruptible, glorious, powerfull, ſpirituall, heauenly, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall;</hi> ſo our bodies ſhal be like: <hi>incorruptible, glorious, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpirituall, heauenly, and immortall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of our likenes vnto Chriſt, both in our bodies, and in our ſoules, Chriſt ſeemeth to ſpeak iointly, when he ſaith <hi>The glory that thou gaueſt me, I haue giuen them, that they may be one as wee are one, I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in me &amp;c. Ioh.</hi> 17. 22 23.</p>
               <p>Although this place of the Apoſtle touching our future ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude to Chriſt, may be vnderſtood of our through &amp; perfect likenes both in ſoule and in body: yet it ſeemeth the Apoſtle <note place="margin">Note.</note> ſpeaketh eſpecially of our likenes vnto Chriſt in our bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that eſpecially is moſt hidden from the world, &amp; of that eſpecially it may be ſaid, that it doth not appeare what we ſhall be. For our future likenes in ſoule, and in our inner man tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the perfect knowledge of God, and touching our
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:18428:233"/> holineſſe and righteouſneſſe begun here, and to be made ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and complete like to the knowledge and holineſſe of Chriſt himſelfe in the reſurrection, is here much more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, perſpicuous, and manifeſt, then the foreſaid future like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our bodies vnto the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For that our likenes of knowledge and holines and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes is apparantly begun in this life: ſo is not our likenes in body touching the properties before mentioned, <hi>incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible glorious powerfull, ſpirituall, heauenly, and immortall.</hi> For our bodies ſeem no more qualified touching theſe things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter regeneration, then before: yea, rather the regenerate by yeeres and ſickneſſes, &amp;c. ſeem to be, and do indeed grow daily more baſe, more weake, and impotent bodies, as well as the vnregenerate.</p>
               <p>Againe, that the Apoſtle here eſpecially intendeth the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of Gods children in body to the body of Chriſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be inſinuated alſo by the proofe following from the effect, viz. <hi>that we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> For this being ſpoken chiefly of the bodily ſight, it followeth likewiſe that our like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto Chriſt confirmed thereby, doth ſignifie chiefly our bodily likenes vnto him.</p>
               <p>This our future likenes vnto Chriſt, Chriſt in part ſhewed in the mountaine; when not only himſelfe was transfigured before <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn, his face ſhining as the Sunne, and his clothes being as bright as the light: Mat. 17. 2. and as white as the ſnow, euen ſo white, as no fuller can make vpon the earth: Mark. 9. 3. but Moſes alſo and Elias appeared, and were talking with him:</hi> both which likewiſe are ſaid <hi>to haue appeared in glory: Luk</hi> 9. 31. For that they appeared not in ſoule only but alſo in body, it is cleere, firſt by that that they were viſibly ſeene of thoſe Apoſtles: Secondly, becauſe it is further ſaid, that <hi>they talked with Chriſt.</hi> Thirdly, becauſe <hi>Luke</hi> alſo expreſly calleth them by the name, not of two ſpirits, but of <hi>two men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This our likeneſſe alſo vnto Chriſt, Chriſt himſelfe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to <hi>thoſe few names in Sardi, which had not defiled their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> ſaying of them <hi>that they ſhould walke with him in white: Reuel. 4. 34.</hi> What is it to be <hi>clothed in white,</hi> and <hi>to walke in white with Chriſt,</hi> but in glory to be made like vnto Chriſt,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:18428:233"/> who before in his transfiguration had ſhewed himſelfe in white? And by this colour of white is the glory of Chriſt and of Gods children rather deſcribed, then by any other colour, becauſe Princes and great potentates of the earth when they would ſhew themſelues, in their greateſt pompe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, did vſe to cloath themſelues in white: yea, ſo did our late moſt renowned Queene oftentime, at the entertainment of ſome great Embaſſadors, and other great ſolemnities.</p>
               <p>This our likenes likewiſe vnto Chriſt, is further promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the ſame chapter, verſe 21. to euery one <hi>that ouer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,</hi> namely in theſe words, that to ſuch <hi>Chriſt will giue to sit,</hi> yea, <hi>to ſit with him in his throne.</hi> What more? <hi>as himſelfe ſitteth in the throne of his Father.</hi> So then as Chriſt is in glory like to his Father, ſo ſhall the children of God alſo be like vnto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This point of our likeneſſe vnto Chriſt, is a moſt ſweet and heauenly point, ſo full of comfort, that it is able to comfort vs though neuer ſo much compaſſed with ſorrowes and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with griefes. It is able to recouer vs, though neuer ſo ſicke of ſinne. It is able to reuiue and reſtore vs, though not only halfe dead, but alſo altogether dead in ſinnes and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes.</p>
               <p>It is much that <hi>wee ſhall ſhine as the brightneſſe of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as the ſtarres for euer: Dan.</hi> 12. as alſo <hi>that we ſhall ſhine as the Sunne it ſelfe in the kingdome of our Father: Mat.</hi> 13. 34.</p>
               <p>It is more that we ſhall be like <hi>to the Angels of God in heauen: Mat.</hi> 22. 30. of whoſe great glory we haue heard before. Who therfore can expreſſe or conceiue this that is here ſpoken, that we ſhall be like vnto Chriſt himſelfe? For what is the brightnes of the firmament; what is the gliſtering of the ſtarres; what is the light of the Sunne, in the greateſt and cleereſt height thereof; what is the glory of the Angels in reſpect of Chriſt Ieſus?</p>
               <p>When he was in the ſhape of a ſeruant, he taught <hi>with ſuch power and authority, that all that heard him, were aſtonied at his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: Mat.</hi> 7. 28. 29. and <hi>wondred at the gratious words that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of his mouth: Luk</hi> 4. 22.</p>
               <p>Yea, the very <hi>officers of the high Prieſts and Phariſies that were
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:18428:234"/> ſent to take him,</hi> being rauiſhed with his words, returned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, and being asked <hi>why they had not brought him, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Neuer man ſpake like this man: Iohn</hi> 7. 32. 45.</p>
               <p>Afterward alſo, his aduerſaries that came out to apprehend him, with one word of his mouth <hi>were turned backe, and fell to the ground: Ioh.</hi> 18. 6. I omit heere the amplification of this point by the glory of <hi>Moſes</hi> his face comming from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the law (which <hi>Moſes</hi> was but a ſeruant) as alſo by the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhment of <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> with the transfiguration of Chriſt in the mount, to giue them a taſt of his glory. Theſe things (I ſay) I do omit, as hauing ſpoken of them before.</p>
               <p>Neither alſo is it to any great purpoſe, to compare the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt, with the glory of the Monarchs of the world: and ſo thereby to amplifie our glory, in regard that we ſhall be like vnto Chriſt. For, alas, all the glory of earthly Princes, is not ſo much as a picture, or a ſhadow of the glory of Chriſt, <hi>who is the firſt begotten of the dead, the Prince of the kings of the earth: Reu. 1. 5. and who walketh in middes of the ſeuen candleſtickes, is cloathed with a garment downe to the feete, and girded about the pappes with a golden girdle, whoſe head and haire are white, as white as wooll, and as ſnowe, and his eies as a flame of fire: and his feete like vnto fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e braſſe, burning as in a fornace: and his voice as the ſound of many waters: hauing in his right hand ſeuen ſtarres, and a ſharpe two-edged ſword going out of his mouth: and whoſe face ſhineth as the Sunne in his ſtrength: Reuel. 1. 13. &amp;c.</hi> To whom alſo being newlie borne, certaine wiſe men did not only <hi>come out of the Eaſt, but alſo fell downe and worſhipped him, opening their treaſures and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting vnto him gifts of gold, and incenſe, and myrrhe: Mat.</hi> 2. 1. and 11.</p>
               <p>Yea, who is ſo excellent, that not only <hi>a multitude of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſouldiers,</hi> ſang at his birth (though he were borne in a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and laid in a manger) <hi>Glory to God in the high heauens, and peace in earth, and towards men good will: Luke</hi> 2. 14. but alſo that afterward the foure and twenty Elders did ſing vnto him <hi>a new ſong ſaying, Thou art worthy to take the booke</hi> (viz. which before <hi>Iohn</hi> had <hi>ſeene in the right hand of him that ſate vpon the throne, written within, and on the backeſide ſealed with ſeauen
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:18428:234"/> ſeales, and which none in heauen and in earth, or vnder the earth, was worthie to open) and to open the ſeales thereof, becauſe thou waſt killed, and haſt redeemed vs to God by thy bloud, out of euerie kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation, and haſt made vs vnto our God Kings and Prieſts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 5. 9. 10.</p>
               <p>Yea, whoſe excellencie, and glorie, and worthineſſe is ſuch, that not only they did ſo ſing, but that alſo <hi>Iohn</hi> did heare <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Angels, round about the throne, &amp;c. euen thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands to ſing with a loud voice, ſaying, Worthy is the lambe that was killed, to receiue power, and riches, and wiſedome, and ſtrength, and honor, and glory, and praiſe.</hi> Yea, concerning whom alſo <hi>he heard all creatures in heauen, on earth, and vnder the earth, and in the ſea, &amp;c. ſaying, Praiſe, and honor, and glory, and power be vnto him, that ſitteth vpon the throne, and vnto the Lambe for euermore:</hi> verſe 11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Chriſt himſelfe be thus excellent, ſhall not we alſo be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent that ſhall be like vnto him? Why then ſhould we be diſmaied? why ſhould we feare? why ſhould any affliction, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſgrace with men, any threatning of men, any pouerty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny baniſhment, any impriſonment, any loſſes, or any other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities make vs to hang down our head? yea, why ſhould any thing take away our ioy from vs? why ſhould we not alwaies in the pangs of the moſt violent and cruell death, reioice with ioy vnſpeakable and glorious?</p>
               <p>Verily in reſpect of this our likenes vnto Chriſt at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to iudgement, all our likenes vnto him here, is but as an earneſt penny. As therefore the earneſt of a man giuen vpon a purchaſe, is the leaſt part of the paiment: and nothing in a manner in reſpect of that which remaineth to be paied: and as the firſt fruits were but an handfull in reſpect of other fruits afterward to be reaped; ſo all the graces of God here, and all our ſimilitude vnto Chriſt in this life, is but a corner, and a pittance (as it were) of this our future likenes vnto him here ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>All the perfection that here the beſt of vs all doe atteine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, is but as a cruſt of bread, in reſpect of an whole loafe: at leaſt, but as a little breakfaſt, to ſtaie our ſtomackes
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:18428:235"/> till the ſupper of the Lambe, when our likenes vnto him ſhall be compleat in all the delineaments and proportion thereof: that ſo we may not thinke the time too long till the ſupper it ſelfe do come.</p>
               <p>All the graces of God likewiſe in this life, and all the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of our regeneration and ſanctification in this life, are but loue tokens, (like to <hi>the iewels of ſiluer and of gold, and the raiment that Abrahams ſeruant gaue to Rebecca, before her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and her brother Laban, as teſtimonies of Iſaacks loue towards her: Gen.</hi> 24. 53) giuen by Ieſus Chriſt vnto vs, againſt the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization of the mariage it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>This likeneſſe of the children of God vnto Chriſt Ieſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God and man, and ſo excellent euery way, as before we heard him to be, doth exceedingly increaſe and amplifie that their dignity, which I haue ſo largely laid forth in handling the maine propoſition of the former verſe: euen as we ſee the creation of the firſt man in the ſimilitude and likenes of God, doth exceedingly commend and ſet forth the excellent ſtate and condition of the ſaid firſt man, ſo long as he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein.</p>
               <p>This is the more, becauſe this ſimilitude once attained in that perfection that is here ſpoken, ſhall neuer bee loſt, as that image of God was, wherein at the firſt we were created: yea it ſhall neuer any more be defaced, or any whit blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Neither Satan, nor the world, nor our owne fleſh ſhall euer any more preuaile in vs to draw vs to any ſinne, for a ſeaſon. All theſe, and all other the enemies of our ſaluation included in theſe, ſhall then bee fully ouercome, and ſubdued: and ſo farre ſhall they be from doing vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny harme in any thing, that they ſhall neuer come neere vs, neither euer bee able to lift vp their leaſt finger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. Then as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaide of the Egyptians to the Iſraelites, <hi>The Aegyptians whom yee haue ſeene this day, yee ſhall neuer ſee them againe:</hi> So ſhall we find it true of all the ſpirituall enemies of our ſaluation, after this our perfect likeneſſe vnto Chriſt thus obtained, <hi>The enemies which we haue ſeene, by whom wee haue beene much moleſted and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: yea, who did often foile and wound vs moſt dangerouſly,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:18428:235"/> we ſhall neuer ſee them any more: yea</hi> (as we ſpeake in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prouerbe) <hi>we ſhall neuer heare or ſee hide nor haire of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much of our future likenes it ſelfe vnto Chriſt. Now followeth the ſecond point here to be conſidered, viz. our knowledge and certainty thereof. For the Apoſtle ſaith not, that howſoeuer it appeare not vnto other, yet we hope or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and looke to be made like vnto him, but he ſaith <hi>we know that we ſhall be like vnto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This word <hi>know,</hi> is not a word of doubting, but of moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. For it is not ſpoken only of the creatures, men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but alſo of God himſelfe. Our Sauiour ſaith twice in one Chapter, that <hi>Our father euen in heauen knoweth what we neede: Mat.</hi> 6. 8. and 32. where is the very ſame word in the originall, that is in this place.</p>
               <p>So it is attributed to Chriſt, <hi>Ieſus knew from the beginning, which they were that beleeued not: Iohn</hi> 6. 64. and againe. <hi>The world hath not knowen thee, but I haue knowen thee, &amp;c. Ioh</hi> 17. 25. in both which places is the very ſame word. Many other the like places there are, where this very word is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God and to Chriſt Ieſus. Shall we think, that their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not certaine?</p>
               <p>There is therefore no queſtion, but that the Apoſtle mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our future knowledge of our likenes vnto Chriſt, to be a thing moſt certain and vndoubted. From whence alſo follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that they that are the children of God are ſure they ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wholly and finally fall away from God; and from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſtate of the children of God before ſpoken of, and wherunto they are called in Chriſt Ieſus. For if they might ſo fall away, then the Apoſtle could not ſpeake of their future likenes vnto Chriſt with that certainty that he doth: neither could he ſay, <hi>we know that we ſhall be like him.</hi> For they that are in danger of finall falling without recouery, doe not certainly know <hi>that they ſhall be like vnto Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>Now as here the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>we know,</hi> ſo afterward verſ. 14. of this preſent chapter he vſeth the ſame phraſe and the ſame word againe in the ſame matter, <hi>Wee know that wee are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from death to life, if wee loue the brethren;</hi> and againe
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:18428:236"/> another word of the ſame ſignification verſe 19, <hi>Hereby wee know that wee are of the truth, and ſhall before him aſſure our hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I haue ſpoken of this certainty of our likenes vnto Chriſt, before in ſpeaking of the certainty of our inheritance: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the leſſe ſhall need in this place; notwithſtanding ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here alſo will be expected by the reader, becauſe I refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him in the former place for further matter of this certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the handling of theſe words.</p>
               <p>For better performance of my ſaid promiſe, and for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfaction of the readers expectation in this behalfe, let vs firſt here in a word remember my former foure arguments (beſides ſome things ſpoken of this point in handling the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of that inheritance mentioned 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4) for demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this certainty. Thoſe arguments therefore in one word were theſe. The firſt was from diuers expreſſe places of Scripture. The ſecond from the immutable conſtancy of God. The third from the righteouſneſſe of God. The fourth from this attribute of all the children of GOD, that they are the members of Chriſt. Theſe are handled before in Chapter 26. and ſhall not need now to be otherwiſe repeated.</p>
               <p>Only for amplification a little of the ſecond former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the immutable conſtancy of God, let vs remember the conſtant ſpeech of <hi>Iſaack,</hi> when he had vnwares, yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods appointment bleſſed his ſonne <hi>Iacob,</hi> whereas he had thought to haue bleſſed <hi>Eſau,</hi> yea, and did thinke that he had ſo done; &amp; when <hi>Eſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> returning home intreated his father <hi>Iſaack</hi> to bleſſe him, according to his former promiſe. For this patriarke <hi>Iſaack</hi> hauing ſo bleſſed <hi>Iaacob,</hi> when his ſonne <hi>Eſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> returned from hunting, and brought Veniſon ready dreſſed vnto him, and craued his bleſſing; this <hi>Izhaack</hi> (I ſay) told his ſonne <hi>Eſau</hi> what had fallen out in his abſence, and ſaith plainly, <hi>I haue bleſſed him, therefore he ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: Geneſ.</hi> 27. 33. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, My bleſſing is paſt already: Thou comeſt now too late: I haue giuen my bleſſing to him to whom by the appointment of God at the firſt it did belong: &amp; therfore whatſoeuer thou haſt done at my
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:18428:236"/> commandement, and howſoeuer I promiſed indeed to bleſſe thee, yet hauing now ſpoken the word for the bleſſing him that came before thee, I neither will, nor can reuoke it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> ſeeming to allude to the former words of <hi>Iſaack,</hi> in his praier for the bleſſing of God vpon his houſe, vſeth the very ſame words almoſt, (if not altogether) ſpeaking thus, <hi>Now it hath pleaſed thee to bleſſe the houſe of thy ſeruant, that it may bee before thee for euer: for thou O Lord, haſt bleſſed it, and it ſhall be bleſſed for euer: 1 Chron.</hi> 17. 27.</p>
               <p>The like conſtancy we read of that heathen, and wicked man <hi>Pilate.</hi> For when hee had written this title vpon the head of Chriſt on the Croſſe, <hi>Ieſus of Nazaret the King of the Iewes,</hi> and when the high Prieſts of the Iewes being offended with the ſaid title, perſwaded him to alter it, and ſaid, <hi>Write not, The king of the Iewes, but that he ſaid, I am the king of the Iewes:</hi> what anſwered <hi>Pilate?</hi> Was he content to alter his former writing? Not ſo: but he anſwered, <hi>What I haue written, I haue written: Iohn</hi> 19. 19. 21. 22.</p>
               <p>Did theſe men, the one an elect of God and a good man the other a reprobate and moſt wicked; did theſe (I ſay) thus hold themſelues to their own, notwithſtanding earneſt requeſts to the contrary? Shall we think that God will ſhrinke, &amp; go back of his word for the caſheering of any, whom once he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled and written in the book of life? No, no, though all the world ſhould ſolicit him to the contrary: yea, though it were poſſible that the Angels of heauen ſhold ſo do, yet wil not God goe one inch back of his word, touching any of his children whom he hath determined to make like vnto his owne ſonne: He will not flinch a whit, or ſtart aſide an heires bredth: but to all ſuch as ſhall plead for the cutting of the names of any of his, out of the table or book of life, he will anſwer as <hi>Iſaack</hi> did to <hi>Eſau, I haue bleſſed them, therfore they ſhall be bleſſed:</hi> and as <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat</hi> anſwered the high prieſts of the Iewes, <hi>whom I haue written, I haue written.</hi> To leaue this argument, and to proceed vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>If they be bleſſed that walke not in the counſell of the wicked, &amp;c. that truſt in the Lord &amp;c. that feare the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> then are they certaine of their future likeneſſe vnto Chriſt. For where there is no certainty therof, there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no bleſſednes. But ſuch
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:18428:237"/> are pronounced bleſſed in the Pſalms, &amp; in the other ſcriptures: therfore they are certaine of this their future likenes to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of the commandement of the Apoſtle giuen to all that are in <hi>Chriſt for reioicing in the Lord:</hi> yea, <hi>for reioicing alwaies: Philip.</hi> 44. For what ioy can there be, where there is continuall doubting of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>his future likenes vnto Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Againe, by ſo many arguments as whereby before we haue laid forth the dignity of Gods children, we may alſo be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of this our future likenes vnto Chriſt, viz. by Gods loue in making vs his children: becauſe <hi>whom he loueth, he loueth to the end:</hi> by the difficulty and greatneſſe of that worke: For would he do ſo difficult, ſo great, and ſo admirable a worke, and not bring it to perfection? or what perfection hath it, without this likenes to Chriſt? by the meanes whereby he worketh it: viz. by the immortall ſeed. For how is that ſeed immortall, if they periſh, that are begotten again by it? I meane touching the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life, whereby they are ſo begotten againe? Or how doe they continue, if they neuer attaine vnto, but come ſhort of this likenes vnto Chriſt? by their vnion with Chriſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Father, and the holy ghoſt, which we heard to be indiſſoluble; once made and neuer diſſolued: by their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and free acceſſe to God in praier, with aſſurance to be heard; as in other things, ſo alſo in asking of this their future likenes vnto Chriſt: by the forgiueneſſe of their ſins, the only let of their likenes vnto him. Gods couenant therein, being a couenant of ſalt, euen an euerlaſting couenant: by the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all things together for their good: by their freedome from condemnation: by the bleſsed inheritance before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of: and almoſt by all the other arguments.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, all that are in heauen may be ſure without doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their future likenes vnto Chriſt: But all the children of God that are regenerated by the word of truth, are in heauen. Therfore they may be ſure without doubting of their future likenes in grace and in glory vnto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt part of this reaſon, that all in heauen may bee ſure without doubting of their future likenes to Chriſt, &amp;c. is ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, that no man will deny the ſame: ſith there is no fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing from thence. That which our Sauiour ſaith, as a
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:18428:237"/> reaſon to prouoke men to lay vp treaſures in heauen, viz. that <hi>There, neither the moth nor canker doth corrupt, nor thieues digge through and ſteale: Mat.</hi> 6. 30. may be ſaid of all perſons in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that they are out of all danger, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the former reaſon, that the children of God regenerated and new borne by the holy ghoſt, are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (from the firſt houre of their regeneration) in heauen, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirmed by the Apoſtle: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
               <p>Moſt men vnderſtanding thoſe words as ſpoken only of the children of God in reſpect of their certainty of heauen, not in reſpect of their preſent poſſeſſion, do notwithſtanding iuſtifie my preſent purpoſe. Notwithſtanding I doe vnderſtand with ſome other much more: euen the preſent poſſeſſion it ſelfe of heauen: preſent (I ſay) not full poſſeſſion: and that becauſe Chriſt Ieſus hauing taken poſſeſſion of heauen, not as one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but as the head of many, euen of all his members; not to his own vſealone, but to theirs; not in his own name alone, but in theirs; it muſt needs be granted that all they alſo are in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſion, whoſe head Chriſt is: to whoſe vſe and in whoſe name, Chriſt hath taken poſſeſſion of heauen. I will il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate this by a law caſe, common amongſt vs.</p>
               <p>A mans wife of <hi>Kent</hi> or <hi>Eſſex,</hi> hath coppy hold land pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by her, or giuen vnto her by ſome friends, in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> in <hi>Weſtmo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The wife therefore goeth not her ſelfe to take poſſeſſion of the ſaid lands: but the husband goeth; maketh it manifeſt to the Lord, to whom ſuch lands are cuſtomary, that he is the lawfull husband of ſuch a woman, and therfore craueth to be admitted, and to take vp the land in her name, and to her vſe. He is ſo admitted. Is not the woman from that time forward, in as good and reall poſſeſſion by her husbands admiſſion, as if ſhe her ſelfe had been there preſent, though ſhe ſtill remaine in the place where ſhe dwelleth, and neuer come foot neerer? It cannot be denied. The like is to be ſaid, touching the preſent poſſeſſion of heauen by all the children of God: who then ſhall diſpoſſeſſe them thereof? If none can diſpoſſeſſe them, why ſhould they doubt? where is the vncertainty?</p>
               <pb n="450" facs="tcp:18428:238"/>
               <p>The obiections againſt this doctrine are of no moment.</p>
               <p>It is no doctrine of pride nor preſumption, becauſe I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, that the conſideration of the great dignitie of the children of God (whereof this is one ſpeciall point) ſhould make men the more to decke themſelues inwardly with all lowlineſſe of minde, and outwardly with all behauiour ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuch inward lowlineſſe.</p>
               <p>It is no doctrine of ſecuritie, becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> touching their iudgement, <hi>to be ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt and vnmoueable;</hi> and touching their practiſe, <hi>to be abundant alwaies in the worke of the Lord, for aſmuch</hi> (not as they hoped, or vncertainly expected, but) <hi>as they knew their labour of their worke was not in vaine in the Lord: 1. Cor.</hi> 15. 58.</p>
               <p>In this Chapter alſo this our Apoſtle afterward prouoketh to brotherly loue, euen to loue not onely in word <hi>and tongue, but alſo in deed and in truth, from their knowledge of being tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from death vnto life, and of being of the truth, and of aſſuring their hearts before God:</hi> verſe 14. and 18. and 19. Yea in this very place it followeth (as we ſhall heare) <hi>Euery one that hath this hope in him, purgeth himſelfe as he is pure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How then can this doctrine of our certainty of ſaluation, and of our likeneſſe vnto Chriſt, bee called by the Papiſts, a doctrine of ſecuritie, being ſo often laid for a foundation of good workes, and vſed for a ſpurre to good workes?</p>
               <p>The great place to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> Chap 6. 4 the chiefe bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke of the Papiſts for defenſe of their doubting and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, as if they that are regenerated might vtterly and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie fall away from the grace of God, and as if conſequently none could heere bee ſure of this future likeneſſe vnto Chriſt, is of no force at all: the walles thereof are but paper walles: yea the truth is, it maketh mainly againſt them, and plainly and vnanſwerably prooueth, that none that once haue true faith, &amp;c. can poſſibly altogether and finally fall away. For in the ninth verſe following the Apoſtle fearing that ſome of them to whome hee did write might take hold of his former doctrine, and applying it to themſelues, might thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in that fearefull ſtate of relapſe which before hee had ſpoken of, preuenteth this obiection, and ſaith, <hi>Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:18428:238"/> we are perſwaded better things of you, and ſuch as accompanie ſaluation.</hi> So he ſheweth, that there were better things then <hi>ſo to be once inlightned, ſo to haue taſted of the heauenly gift, ſo to haue beene made partaker of the holy Ghoſt, ſo to haue taſted of the good word of God, and of the power of the world to come,</hi> as before he had ſpoken. So alſo hee teacheth, that thoſe better things only, which he meaneth in the ninth verſe, did accompanie ſaluation, and that therefore he had not before meant a true, liuely, and iuſtifying faith, and that vnfained and pure Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian loue, whereby faith worketh: for what better things can there be, then this faith and loue?</p>
               <p>If yet any replie, that that ninth verſe is not to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in reſpect of the things mentioned in the 4. 5. and 6. verſes, but onely of that which is ſaid in the 7. and 8. verſes: I anſwer, that this is but an heartleſſe, pithleſſe, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe obiection, yea indeed fooliſh and ridiculous. For the 7. and 8. verſes being the confirmation of that which was ſaid in the 4. 5. and 6. verſes, how can the 9. verſe be referred onely to the 7. and 8. verſes, and not alſo to the 4. 5. and 6?</p>
               <p>In this point of the certainty of our future likeneſſe vnto Chriſt, let vs obſerue the firſt perſon, <hi>Wee know,</hi> and that <hi>wee ſhall be like.</hi> Thereby he teacheth, that only they, and all they ſhall be like vnto Chriſt, which before hee had ſaid were the children of God. All they indeed haue not alwaies the like knowledge, or the like feeling of this knowledge of their like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to Chriſt, becauſe of ſome afflictions, and becauſe of too much liberty giuen to their ſinnes, which by the ſaid libertie doe grow vp to bee a thicke groue to ſtand before their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and to eclipſe, obſcure, and hide the light of the ſunne of righteouſneſſe from ſhining into the houſe of their inner man ſo cleerely as in former time it hath done.</p>
               <p>As men alſo, though neuer ſo learned, in their ſleepe haue no more vſe of their learning then men altogether vnlearned, and yet for all that they ſtill haue that learning which they had waking; ſo is it with the children of God touching this their knowledge of their likeneſſe vnto Chriſt. Being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ouertaken with the ſleepe of ſome or of many ſinnes, for a time they are depriued of the vſe of the former knowledge:
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:18428:239"/> viz. ſo long as their ſaid ſleepe in ſinne continueth. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they ſtill haue their former knowledge, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the vſe of it againe, when they ſhall be awakened out of their ſleepe of ſinne. But to this point, many things may be referred, that haue been ſpoken in the former part of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: therefore I ſhall not need to ſpeake any more thereof in this place.</p>
               <p>The more excellent that the ſubiect of this knowledge is, viz. our likeneſſe vnto Chriſt, the more let all, both Scholars and other, be prouoked to ſtudy this knowledge: yea let all other ſtudies, and all other learning, giue place to this, and be referred to this. Neither let any other knowledge and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be in any account, but for this, and as it may helpe and further vs vnto this.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the knowledge and certainty of our future likeneſſe vnto Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Of the time when the children of God ſhall be ſo like vnto Christ, as before we heard: and of the reaſon of the ſaid likeneſſe, by an effect thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T followeth now to ſpeake of the time when the children of God ſhall be like to Chriſt. This is ſaid to be at his appearing. This time is alſo noted, <hi>Coloſſ. 3. 4. Tit. 2. 13. 1. Pet.</hi> 1. 5. and 7. I doe but name the places, not expreſſing the words, becauſe I haſten.</p>
               <p>By his appearing he meaneth his ſecond comming, in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and all maieſtie, accompanied with his holy Angels, and comming to iudge the quicke and the dead; as at his former comming in the forme of a ſeruant, he came to be iudged, and not to iudge.</p>
               <p>This is called his appearing, becauſe as the Goſpell or <hi>grace of God, which bringeth ſaluation vnto all men,</hi> is ſaid, <hi>now to haue appeared, Tit.</hi> 2. 11. in reſpect <hi>it had beene kept ſecret be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince the world began, and had not beene ſo opened as it is now

Epheſ.</hi> 3. 5. ſo Chriſt Ieſus being aſcended into heauen, and there ſitting at the right hand of his father, is not now ſo manifeſted, at leaſt to the bodily ſight, as hee ſhall manifeſt himſelfe at his ſecond comming.</p>
               <p>This time of this his appearing is his mariage day, whereas all time before is but as it were the time of his and our betroth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of the preparing of vs for that mariage day, to be the fitter ſpouſe for him.</p>
               <p>All this ſentence of our certainty and knowledge of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Note.</note> made like vnto Chriſt at his appearing, is not to bee taken as ſpoken in the perſon of the Apoſtle onely, and of them to whom he did write, but of all other the children of God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. None muſt looke for this perfection and likeneſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt before this time of his appearing.</p>
               <p>What then (will ſome man aske) doe you ſay of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias?</hi> Of the one it is ſaid, that <hi>he walked with God, and was no more ſeene, for God tooke him away: Geneſ.</hi> 5. 24. And againe, that <hi>By faith Enoch was tranſlated, that he ſhould not ſee death: neither was he found, for God had tranſlated him: Heb.</hi> 11. 5. Of the other (of <hi>Elias) that he went vp by a whirlewinde into Heauen: 2. King</hi> 2. 11.</p>
               <p>Concerning therefore the two former examples of whom the queſtion is mooued, whatſoeuer men haue thought, or doe thinke, and whatſoeuer the former words may ſeeme to inſinuate (which their inſinuated ſenſe ſhall be opened after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) this I thinke, that they are not yet bodily in heauen <note place="margin">Enoch and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias not bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yet in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</note> neither ſhall be till the reſurrection of all fleſh, when all the reſt of Gods elect ſhall receiue their conſummation and perfect bliſſe.</p>
               <p>My reaſons for this opinion are briefly theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. after the mention as well of <hi>Enoch</hi> as of <note place="margin">1. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Noah, Abraham.</hi> and <hi>Sara,</hi> it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>All theſe died in faith.</hi> It were abſurd to reſtraine the generall word <hi>all</hi> onely to the three laſt, and not to extend it alſo vnto <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</hi> Therefore it is manifeſt, that theſe two died as well as the other three.</p>
               <p>If it be obiected, that it is ſaid before, that <hi>Enoch was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:18428:240"/> that he might not ſee death,</hi> and that therefore, if here this verbe <hi>died</hi> bee as well vnderſtood of him as of the reſt, then there ſhall be contrarieties in one and the ſame place. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the reconciliation of this doubt is very eaſie: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by interpreting the former phraſe, that <hi>hee might not ſee death,</hi> of not feeling death after the common painfull manner of men. And ſo the word <hi>to ſee,</hi> for to feele, or to diſcerne, or by experience to perceiue, is often taken in the Scripture. <hi>The waters ſaw thee, O God, the waters ſaw thee,</hi> &amp;c. that is, they did as it were feele, and by experience perceiued thy power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 16. So the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I ſee another Law in my members,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>I feele, Rom.</hi> 7. 23. There might bee many other the like places alleged: but theſe are ſufficient.</p>
               <p>That alſo of being <hi>tranſlated,</hi> ſignifieth nothing els, but he was taken away in an extraordinary manner, not ſeen of men, but ſo ſecretly, that no man knew, or by any outward thing could iudge otherwiſe of him, but as if God tooke him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly into heauen: And ſo would God in that euill and ſinfull age take him away ſo gently, and extraordinarily diſſoluing the ſoule and the body, that men might thinke him, to goe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule into heauen, for the better honoring that holy life, which he then liued: the rather becauſe all other liued ſo wickedly. To any but very meanly exerciſed in the Scripture it is well knowen, that many things are ſpoken according to the opinion of men; according to that which they ſeemed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men. So <hi>Samuel</hi> is ſaid to haue been raiſed (after death) by the witch, and to haue ſpoken vnto <hi>Saul: 1. Sam 28. 11. &amp;c.</hi> Not that it was <hi>Samuel (For they that die in the Lord reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors: Reu.</hi> 14. 13. and are not therefore at the call or command of witches) but onely becauſe he appeared in the likeneſſe of <hi>Samuel</hi> (as Satan can change himſelfe into the likeneſſe of an Angell of light: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14) and becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany tooke him ſo to be.</p>
               <p>My ſecond reaſon is out of the ſame Chapter. For of all the former, and of diuers other examples afterward mentioned, it is written thus, <hi>All theſe through faith obtained good report, and receiued not the promiſe, God prouiding a better thing for vs, that they without vs ſhould not be made perfect.</hi> verſe 39. 40. If <hi>Enoch</hi>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:18428:240"/> had beene taken vp in body into heauen, then had hee beene made perfect without vs.</p>
               <p>My third reaſon is out of the ſame Epiſtle alſo, Chapt. 9. 8. where the Apoſtle, by the entrance or going once yee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ely of the high Prieſt alone into <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> into the moſt holy place, doth teach, that vnder the Law, <hi>and whiles the firſt Tabernacle was ſtanding, the way into the holieſt of all was not yet opened.</hi> What meaneth the Apoſtle by <hi>the holieſt of all,</hi> but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, eſpecially for the bodies of men to enter thereinto? For howſoeuer God had prepared heauen to be the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of the ſoules of the righteous after death, yet Chriſt was the firſt that entred in body.</p>
               <p>And this ſeemeth to bee the ſtronger argument, becauſe in the deſcription of heauen in the ſame epiſtle afterward, Chap. 12. 23. it is called <hi>the city of the liuing God the celeſtial Ieruſalem,</hi> which hath <hi>the company of innumerable Angels, the aſſembly of the congregation of the firſt borne, which are written in heauen, and God the iudge of all, and the ſpirits of iuſt and perfect men, and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Mediator of the new Teſtament.</hi> Heere therefore is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Angels, of God, of the ſpirits of iuſt men, and of Ieſus the Mediator: heere is no mention at all of any bodies, or of any men altogether in heauen. If any will reply, that this is a deſcription of the whole Church in heauen and in earth, both gouernours, children, and ſeruants; I anſwer, that then the words <hi>[the congregation of the firſt borne]</hi> muſt comprehend the Church militant in earth, and ſo there will bee none found in heauen, but <hi>God, Ieſus Chriſt, the ſpirits of iuſt and perfect men, and the Angels.</hi> So all bodies, beſide the body of Chriſt, are yet excluded.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in the deſcription of the reſurrection, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 52. there is no other ſort mentioned, but the dead to bee rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the liuing at that time vpon the earth to be changed: <hi>The trumpet ſhall blow, and the dead ſhall be raiſed vp incorruptible, and we</hi> (viz all which at that day ſhall be liuing) <hi>ſhalbe changed.</hi> The like is, 1. <hi>Theſſ. 4. 15. 16. 17. This ſay we vnto you by the word of the Lord, that we which liue and are remaining in the comming of the Lord ſhall not preuent them which ſleepe: for the Lord himſelfe ſhall deſcend downe from heauen with a ſhout, and with the voice of
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:18428:241"/> an Archangell, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe first. Then ſhall wee which liue and remaine be caught vp with them alſo in the clouds,</hi> &amp;c. In neither of both theſe places is there any mention of any but of the dead, and of the liuing and remaining here vpon the earth. <hi>Enoch</hi> therfore and <hi>Elias</hi> muſt be reckned with the dead, &amp; accounted as dead; though they died in an extraordinary maner, neither violent or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to themſelues, or diſcerned by other.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, all the elect being compared to a body, and it being contrary to the nature of a body, that any one member ſhould bee perfected, till the body haue all the members belonging thereunto, how can it bee, that one or two of the members of Chriſts body ſhould be perfected and wholly glorified in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, Chriſt wanting many members, and not being compleat in his ſaid body, till the very laſt age of the world, and till the laſt point of the ſaid age? For who can deny, but that there are many of the elect yet vnborne? When alſo they ſhall bee all borne, who can deny, but that they ſhall be called one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another? Till all be borne, and all be called, Chriſts body is not perfect.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, who can deny the Miniſters of the Goſpell to bee more excellent (eſpecially the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts, who firſt planted the Churches among the Gentiles) who (I ſay) can deny theſe to bee more honorable then any Miniſters vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law? Much more then any before the Law. This hath beene ſhewed before: therefore I doe not now ſtand vpon it. This only I adde, that it is ſaid of the Apoſtles (as an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, and as a dignity and prerogatiue of them aboue all other) namely, that <hi>they ſhould ſit vpon twelue ſeats</hi> (or thrones) <hi>and iudge the twelue tribes of Iſrael: Matth.</hi> 19. 28. It is likewiſe to be acknowledged, that as the calling was more honourable then the calling of any of the Prophets, ſo alſo they had more excellent graces, not only ſpeciall for diſcharge of their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall places, but alſo generally of ſanctification. Is this ſo? How vnlikely then is it, that any, eſpecially vnder the Law, or before the Law, ſhould haue any degree of glory, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly glorified before them?</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, there were ſome as wicked in their time, before
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:18428:241"/> their time, and after their time, and daily are, as they (now in queſtion) were godly: yea former times, and theſe laſt times doe affoord many much more wicked then they then were, or any other are godly.</p>
               <p>Such was <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> that made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſinne, <hi>Ahab,</hi> and many other of the kings of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So <hi>Iudas</hi> that betraied our Sauiour: the Phariſees that ſinned againſt the holy Ghoſt: <hi>the man of ſinne,</hi> called likewiſe <hi>the ſonne of perdition, the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie that exalteth himſelfe againſt all that is called God,</hi> &amp;c. and many other contemners of the Goſpell. Yet none of theſe doe goe bodily into the place of all the damned, till the day of iudgement. Why then ſhould wee thinke that they before named <hi>(Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias)</hi> went bodily into heauen, the place of the bleſſed?</p>
               <p>This that I haue hitherto written of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> is the iudgement of diuers other that muſt bee acknowledged to haue beene glorious lights, and worthy of much praiſe in the Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caluin</hi> indeed writeth heerein ſomewhat obſeurely, and (I confeſſe) ſomewhat aboue my reach and capacitie: for firſt thus hee writeth vpon <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 5. 24. euen word for word: (the Latine turned into Engliſh) <hi>In ſumme</hi> (ſaith hee, ſpeaking of <hi>Enochs</hi> taking away) <hi>ſuch a rapture</hi> (or taking away) <hi>was but a gentle and ioifull paſſage out of this world. Yet he was not receiued into the heauens to glorie, but was onely releaſed of the miſeries of this preſent life, vntill Chriſt the firſt fruits of them that riſe again ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ould come. And ſith bee was one of the members of the Church, it was neceſſarie that hee ſhould wait till all (the members) together ſhould come foorth to meet Chriſt, that the whole body might bee vnited to the head.</hi> Notwithſtanding, in the very next words he doth much obſcure that which before hee had written, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>If any ſhall obiect that of the Apoſtle, It is appointed all men to die once; the ſolution is eaſie, namely, that death doth not alwaies make a diuorce of the ſoule and body: but they are ſaid to die, which put off the corruptible nature; in which manner they ſhall die whom the laſt day ſhall finde remaining.</hi> Theſe laſt words (I confeſſe) I cannot conceiue: namely, how any may be ſaid to die, whoſe ſoules and bodies are not ſeparated: and how they that ſhall
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:18428:242"/> be liuing at the laſt day, may be ſaid to die, whom the Apoſtle expreſly ſaith ſhall not die, but only be changed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> (according to his manner) writeth very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and ſomewhat (I confeſſe) different from ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore written by me: namely, in his Commentarie vpon 2. <hi>King.</hi> 2. 11. Notwithſtanding, in another place he commeth neerer vnto me, and agreeth more with me.</p>
               <p>In the former place firſt he writeth, that it is <hi>not probable or <note place="margin">Conſent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>eum.</note> like, that theſe two (Enoch and Elias) ſhould be taken to the places of bleſſedneſſe, before Chriſt himſelfe, which is the firſt fruits of all, had aduanced himſelfe thither. The words alſo of our Lord may ſeeme to perſwade this, who in Iohn ſaith, No man hath aſcended into heauen, but the ſonne of man that deſcended from heauen. He therefore denieth any man to haue aſcended into heauen before himſelfe,</hi> &amp;c. Yet afterward hee ſaith, that they went bodie and ſoule <hi>into Abrahams boſome:</hi> and he maketh <hi>Abrahams bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome</hi> a place aboue, yet diſtinct from the glorious place where Chriſt, and all his Saints departed this life, are. How ſound this is, I leaue to other of ſound iudgement. For my part, I know no ſuch diſtinction as he there maketh.</p>
               <p>After this he proceedeth further, denying them to haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, oppoſing himſelfe to them that ſaid as I haue written, viz. that they died, but yet an extraordinary kinde of death, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by any defect or decay of nature, nor by any force and violence, but after ſome other ſort with eaſe and delight, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, in the other place before inſinuated, he differeth from that which himſelfe had before written, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with me. For writing of the Euchariſt againſt <hi>Steuen Gardiner, Loc.</hi> 1. and anſwering the 11. obiection of <hi>Gardiner,</hi> thus he writeth: <hi>If you doe beleeue that Enoch and Elias doe yetliue, you doe beleeue it without the Scripture. Elias was taken away after an admirable ſort, and withdrawen from Elizeus in a firie chariot: but that his ſpirit was not ſtript from his body, by what te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of Scripture will you prooue it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then immediately concerning <hi>Enoch,</hi> hee acknowledging that which is written, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5. to haue beene done, that God might teſtifie, by his ſaid extraordinary kinde of tranſlating, his loue towards him, for the better prouocation of other to
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:18428:242"/> the imitation of his goodneſſe, hee demandeth of <hi>Gardiner, But how know you, that afterward</hi> (viz. after his taking from the Common ſight of men) <hi>he dyed not when he was ſafe, and out of danger of ſinne? you will ſay, that the epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes bath, that he might not ſee death: A man may vnderſtand that, that he might not feele death, whiles he was in the world; that he might not die a common, and an ordinarie death. But that hee died not after his tranſlation, how will you make vs belieue? And there want no: Hebrew writers, which expounding the ſecond booke of the Kings doe ſay, that Elias his body and all his garments, (except his cloake</hi> or mantle) <hi>were conſumed in the whirlweinge: but that the Spirit of the Prophet went vnto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oecolampadius in Heb. 11. 5. citing the words of Geneſis tranſlated by the Septuagints, <hi>And Enoch pleaſed God, and was not found becauſe God tranſlated him. Notwithſtanding</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by theſe words it is not prooued, that hee did not die: Becauſe if hee were of the ſeede of Adam, it muſt be, that hee was mortall. And truely this is moſt agreeable to truth, and conſonant to the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of faith. For Chriſt alone is the firſt begotten of the dead, and hath opened paradiſe to them that beleeue. And that which moueth me more, ſo long time as Christ had not payed the price of our redemption, ſo long alſo a long ſword, or a fierce and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſword, did ſtop all paſſage into paradiſe. If alſo he were tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into paradiſe, how did Chriſt bold ſafe his dignitie? But if you will make here a miracle, then he muſt yet looke for death, and a change. But if any will obſerue the maner of the Apoſtle, bee will not meruaile, that he hath ſaid, that he did not ſee death. For as wee haue ſeene him to doe before touching Melchiſedech, hee would affirme nothing beſides the teſtimonie of the Scripture, and becauſe that he ſaith not expreſly that he died, therefore he did not endeauour to ſet downe ſo much. In the meane time notwithſtanding he denyeth him not to haue died, as likewiſe he doth not Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeth. &amp;c.</hi> Thus much Occolampadius. Martinus Borrhaus, a learned writer about the yeare 1539. in his commentaries vpon Geneſis, Chap. 5. 24. doth ſo interpret that place as I doe. That worthy and famous man M. Doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> alſo, is moſt plainly of my ſide, and agreeth fully with me. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing the marginall note of the Rhemiſh tranſlators of the
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:18428:243"/> new teſtament vpon <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 8. he ſaith, <hi>that heauen was not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by the ſacrifices of the firſt tabernacle, &amp;c. and that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour was the firſt that entred into perfect glorie of heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So to their marginall note vpon Heb. 11. 5. <hi>that there it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that Enoch yet liueth and is not dead, againſt the Caluiniſts,</hi> he briefly anſwereth thus, <hi>It appeareth not that Enoch yet liueth in bodie, more then Moſes or Elias, but that hee was tranſlated by God out of the world, and died not after the common maner of men.</hi> So he inſinuateth that he died, but not after the common ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men. To their notes at large vpon Reu. 11. 3. he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thus, <hi>You will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>proue that they</hi> (that is, Enoch and Elias) <hi>are aliue in paradiſe. But what place is paradiſe but heauen? as the Apoſtle declareth.</hi> 2. Cor. 12. 2. and 4. <hi>for earthly paradiſe either by the flood, or before was defaced. Now what doctrine it is to affirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that men in mortall bodies aſcended into heauen, I leaue to the learned to conſider.</hi> And preſently after, <hi>It is euident indeed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that Elias was taken vp aliue but not that hee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth aliue. Yea, becauſe it is ſaid expreſly that he was taken vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, it is certaine, that his body was not carried into heauen, for Chriſt was the firſt, that in whole humanity aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Samuel Bird</hi> likewiſe (a learned and godly mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter late of Ipſwich in Suffolke) writing vpon Heb. 11. 5. ſaith thus: <hi>It is ſaid, that he was taken vp, that he might not ſee death: the meaning is that he did not die after the common maner of men: he was exempted from the violent ſeparation of the ſoule from the body, which nature doth abhorre: not but that his bodi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> did waſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and did not aſcend into heauen. For Chriſt is the firſt, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in his body into heauen, to take poſſeſſion of it for vs.</hi> Heb. 9. 12.</p>
               <p>With the former teſtimonies affirming that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> are not bodily, yet in heauen, but that their bodies were diſſolued, as well as the bodies of other (though after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary maner) I may ioine the teſtimonie of Doctor <hi>Downam.</hi> For in his ſecond booke of Antichriſt, chap. 6. page 59. though he doe not plainely affirme as much as the former Authors haue done, yet he maketh it ſo doubtfull of their bodies yet being in heauen, that a man may eaſily perceiue, that he rather inclineth to the former writers then otherwiſe.</p>
               <pb n="461" facs="tcp:18428:243"/>
               <p>The obiections to the contrary, are of no moment, and be anſwered before.</p>
               <p>Onely where it is ſaid, <hi>that Elias was carried vp in a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde into heauen,</hi> firſt wee muſt vnderſtand, that ſome read this word <hi>heauen,</hi> in the geniti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e caſe thus, <hi>carried vp in a whirlewinde of heauen.</hi> Secondly, the word <hi>heauen,</hi> in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is often vſed for the aire; or for all aboue the earth. <hi>Let the foule flie vpon the earth, in the open firmament of the heauen.</hi> Gen. 1. 20. ſo, <hi>the foules of the heauen.</hi> verſe 26. and in diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places.</p>
               <p>And that it is ſo here to be taken, it is the more probable, becauſe it is not to be thought, but that <hi>Elias</hi> had other gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beſides his mantle. Except therefore his ſaid other garments were carried vp into the high heauen, we muſt grant that the word <hi>heauen</hi> doth only ſignify the aire: in the which his body might as well waſte, as his other garments (beſides his mantle which fell from him) did conſume.</p>
               <p>Some man (perhaps) may thinke all this diſcourſe of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> to bee altogether idle, and impertinent vnto my preſent treatiſe of the dignity of Gods children, and a meere digreſſion from the ſame. But if it be well conſidered, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth much for it; as much amplifying the ſaid dignity of Gods children. For ſith <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were ſo rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men for their times, as the Scriptures commend them to be: and for further teſtifying of their rareneſſe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, were honoured with ſo rare and extraordinary a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation out of this world, and yet are not in their bodies glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, neither ſhall be, till all the reſt of Gods children ſhall bee glorified and made like vnto Chriſt, at his ſecond comming in all pomp and maieſty; doth not the Lord thereby teſtify vnto all the world, that all his children are in ſo high regard &amp; account with him, that he will not haue the firſt and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt (as it were) to be aduanced to the perfection of happines, till the whole number be accompliſhed, and till the laſt and the meaneſt be borne, and made fit for the like perfection and happines, that all and euery one may receiue their crownes together?</p>
               <p>If a King or ſome other great perſon, make a great feaſt, and
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:18428:244"/> inuite many thereunto: and ſome come betimes, ſome that dwell further of, tary ſomewhat longer: and the maſter of the feaſt, will not haue them that firſt come, to ſit downe, till all the reſt be come, is it not a great gracing and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing of all the gueſts, ſo to prolong the time of ſitting downe, till the reſt be come? Though ſome may thinke that the firſt are ſomewhat diſgraced and wronged by ſtaying for the laſt; yet the matter well weighed, they may conſider, that euen ſo the Lord of the feaſt, would haue ſtayed the reſt for them, if the reſt had come firſt, and the firſt had tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to be laſt. Yea, all men may well ſee the ſaid Lord of the feaſt to be well perſwaded of their loue and patience, in ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for the comming of them that remaine. It is the chiefe honour of any gueſt, inuited by one much greater then himſelfe, to be openly graced with teſtimony of the good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Lord of ſuch a feaſt. For ſo all men may ſee, that the Lord of ſuch a feaſt, hath good regard, as well of them that come late, as of them that came firſt: and of them that came firſt, as of them that come after.</p>
               <p>By all hitherto ſpoken of this time when we ſhall be made like vnto Chriſt, let vs learne, firſt to be patient till that time come. Secondly, the longer it is ere it do come, the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to pray for that day of Chriſts comming, &amp; the oftner in all zeale to ſay, <hi>Come Lord Ieſus, come quickly.</hi> I doe but briefly note, or rather name things, leauing the larger diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of them to other: and euer to the meditation of the godly reader.</p>
               <p>Thus much of our ſimilitude and likenes vnto Chriſt: of our certaintie thereof: and of the time when we ſhall enioy it. The confirmation of our ſaid ſimilitude or likeneſſe vnto Chriſt followeth; which is, that <hi>we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi>

<pb n="463" facs="tcp:18428:244"/> of <hi>Luke,</hi> doe vrge the originall word ſignifying <hi>becauſe,</hi> as there noting the loue of the woman to haue beene the cauſe of the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes: whereas our Sauiour rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth not from the cauſe to the effect, but from the effect to the cauſe, aſſuring her (and other then and there preſent) not for that loue which before ſhee had ſhewed, but by that loue which then ſhe did ſhew ſo abundantly towards him, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinnes were forgiuen her. As the ſame (viz. that much loue of man towards God and Chriſt, are not the cauſe, but an effect of the forgiueneſſe of many ſinnes, and doe not goe before, but follow the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes:) As this (I ſay) is plaine by the parable of two debtors (before in that Chapter menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned) to one of which were forgiuen but 50. pence, and to the other 500. and concerning whom our Sauiour had asked the Phariſee (with whom he then dined) not which had loued, but which would loue the Creditor moſt: ſo it is the more plaine by this place, where the ſame coniunction is taken for a note of an effect, not of a cauſe of our former ſimilitude and likenes vnto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It is ſo alſo taken, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 44. where our Sauiour ſaith of the diuell, <hi>He abode not in the truth, becauſe there is no truth in him.</hi> Heere the ſame word <hi>[becauſe]</hi> is a note of an effect. For Chriſt prooueth the diuell not to haue abidden in the truth, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe before his fall there had beene no truth in him (for hee was created an Angell of light as well as. other) but becauſe now there is no truth in him.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Ioh. 15. 15. I haue called you my friends, for</hi> (or <hi>becauſe) all things that I haue heard of my father I haue made knowen vnto you.</hi> Heere the ſame word alſo noteth an effect, not a cauſe. Thus then the Apoſtle prooueth that wee ſhall bee made like vnto Chriſt at his appearing, by an effect of this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that is, <hi>becauſe wee ſhall ſee him as hee is.</hi> This <hi>to ſee Christ as hee is,</hi> is not the cauſe of our being like vnto him; but our being like vnto him ſhall bee the cauſe of our ſeeing him as he is. For wee cannot ſee him as he is, except firſt wee be made like vnto him. The effect is not before the cauſe, but the cauſe before the effect.</p>
               <p>By ſeeing here he meaneth ſeeing with our bodily eies: and
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:18428:245"/> by ſeeing him as he is, the ſeeing of him plainely, not obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: fully, not in part: face to face, not on his back parts, as <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to haue ſeene God: <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 23. not as <hi>a mightie God alone,</hi> but alſo as a Sauiour: and therefore not in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature alone, but vnder the veile (as it were) of this huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and yet alſo in ſo great glory, as no fleſh liuing did euer ſee the like.</p>
               <p>This ſeeing of him in this maner, is oppoſed to <hi>ſeeing him through a glaſſe darkely, and to knowing of him in part.</hi> 1. Cor. 13. 12. Where theſe two words, ſeeing and knowing, ſeeme to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that there we ſhall both ſee him more plainely with our bodily eies, and alſo know him more perfectly in our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, then here we do or can doe. For here wee ſee him but by pictures and images: I meane not by dead pictures &amp; images, made by men, but by the liuing pictures and images, of our ſelues and of other Gods children, repreſenting him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, and made onely, (as before wee heard) by God himſelfe: as alſo we ſee him by outward ſignes and elements, with the actions belonging vnto them, (that is, the ſacraments) ordeined by him ſelfe. And here wee know him by his word, euen by hearing ſuch things of him, as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee hath reuealed: but then wee ſhall ſee him in his owne perſon, and in that glory where unto now he is aduanced. <hi>Ioh. 17. 24. Father I will, that they which thou haſt giuen me, be with me, euen where I am, that they may behold my glorie:</hi> viz. the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his mercie, grace and goodnes (more then euer before they had done) as well as the glorie of his perſon and iuſtice. The wicked and reprobate ſhall behold the glory of his perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and heare and feele the glory of his iuſtice (that is, his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious iuſtice) not to their comfort, but to their woe: and no otherwiſe, then as malefactors behold the faces of the Iudges and all their ſolemnity wherein they ſit at our aſſiſes, &amp; heare there ſentences: and finally ſo ſhall they ſee and heare theſe things, that they ſhall wiſh (as we haue heard) the hilles and mountaines to fall vpon them, to hide them from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>But the children of God ſhall behold him as their Sauiour,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:18428:245"/> to their vnſpeakeable ioy and comfort. Yea, how great their ioy and comfort ſhall be by this ſight, appeareth by that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that men take in the ſight of mortall Princes; by that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and ioy that many had to ſee Chriſt in his baſenes: (the wiſe men. Mat. 2. the ſhepheards and <hi>Simeon,</hi> Luc. 2. <hi>Zacheus,</hi> Luk. 19. and the Grecians, Ioh. 12.) as alſo by that before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. of <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> being ſo rauiſhed with the ſight of the glorious transfiguration of Chriſt in the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that forgetting themſelues to haue beene then clothed with their naturall, mortall, and vile bodies, they could haue beene contented, and did indeed deſire to haue dwelt there for euer.</p>
               <p>If all theſe tooke ſuch delight in theſe ſights, how comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, how ſweete, how pleaſant, how ioyfull ſhall this ſight of Chriſt Ieſus be, thus to <hi>ſee him,</hi> not as ſometime hee was in his baſenes, but <hi>as</hi> now <hi>he is</hi> in his glory?</p>
               <p>In reſpect of this ſight, all the ſight that wee haue here, is not ſo much as the ſight of the blindman, when Chriſt had begunne ſo to open his eies, that he ſaid <hi>bee did ſee men walke like trees.</hi> Mark. 8. 24.</p>
               <p>Our ſight here touching this obiect thereof, is no better then the ſight of <hi>Iſaak, Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Eli,</hi> when they were old, and when their eies were ſo dimme, that they tooke (as we ſay) hob for nob, one for another: yea, that they could not diſcerne any man, but either by his ſpeech, or by asking who he was.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay more? Touching this ſight, let vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſaid of the report ſhe had heard of <hi>Salomons</hi> wiſdome in her owne Country, and of that which ſhe found by her owne experience. For <hi>when ſhe had ſeene all Salomons wiſedome, and the houſe that bee had built, and the meat of his table, and the ſitting of his ſeruants, and the order of his Miniſters, and their apparell, and his drinking veſſels, and his burnt offerings that hee offered in the houſe of the Lord, ſhee was greatly aſtonied, and ſaid vnto the King. It was a true word that I heard in my owne Land of thy ſayings, and of thy wiſdome. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, I beleeued not this report, till I came and had ſeene it with
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:18428:246"/> mine eies. But loe the one halfe was not told me,</hi> &amp;c. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 10 45. 6. 7.</p>
               <p>In like ſort it may bee ſaid of this ſight, and of all the reſt of our future ſtate a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d condition, which we ſhall enioy, <hi>when we ſhall at his appearing be made like vnto him, and ſee him as he is.</hi> For fleſh and blood doth not beleeue, neither can beleeue, that that is ſaid in the written word of theſe things, yea, hee that hath the moſt faith doth hardly beleeue all that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: at leaſt, though hee beleeue at ſometimes, yet at other times this faith is much exerciſed with doubts, eſpecially for applying theſe things to himſelfe; yet all is moſt true that we heare in this land of our pilgrimage of theſe things: <hi>of our likenes vnto Chriſt, and of our ſeeing him as he is: but loe, the one halfe of them is not told vs,</hi> neither in the Scriptures (becauſe indeed we are not capable thereof) neither much leſſe by our miniſters, not onely becauſe of the negligence of many: but alſo becauſe of want of vnderſtanding in the moſt; yea, euen in the beſt concerning theſe things. For if <hi>Paul</hi> concerning theſe things, as well as concerning other myſteries, could ſay of himſelfe, as well as of other, <hi>wee know in part, and ſee through a glaſſe darkely;</hi> And againe, <hi>Now I know in part:</hi> how much more (alaſſe) may we poore and ſilly miniſters (in reſpect of him) make the like confeſſion, of our <hi>ſeeing and knowing</hi> theſe high and future myſteries but in part?</p>
               <p>O Chriſtian readers, let theſe things comfort vs in all our troubles. In the mids of our afflictions, let vs ſo conſider of theſe things, that as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of thoſe to whom hee did write, ſo we may feele our hearts to leape for ioy within vs (ſo the word doth ſignify) and <hi>to reioice with ioy vnſpeakeable and glorious.</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 6. &amp; 8. When the virgin newly conceiued with Chriſt, viſited her couſin <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the wife of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 6 moneths gone with <hi>Iohn Baptiſt)</hi> it is ſaid that the babe (viz. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt) did leap, or ſpring in the wombe of Elizabeth at the ſalutation of the virgine,</hi> Luk. 1. 41. and 44. As that babe by the ſecret worke of Gods ſpirit, did ſo leape and ſpring at the ſalutation of the virgine ſo newly conceiued with Chriſt, afterward, to bee borne in the forme of â ſeruant, yet a redeemer of the elect: ſo and much more let our
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:18428:246"/> hearts leape and skippe (as it were) in vs, ſo often as we heare of this laſt warning of Chriſt in glory, for perfecting of the whole worke of mans redemptions, and of <hi>this our ſeeing him as he is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, let vs the more reioice, becauſe this ſight is not for a day, or for a yeere, or ſor many yeers, but for euer and euer. As <hi>this world paſſeth away,</hi> ſo alſo doth euery luſt thereof; euen the luſt of the eies, as well as the luſt of any other member: 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 17. yea, much ſooner. But this ſight now ſpoken of, is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting ſight. Leſt vs therefore account of all worldly ſights in reſpect of this, but as of toies and bables: more fit for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren then for men: yea, for fooles, then for them that are wiſe, and of any vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the confirmation of our former future like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vnto Chriſt, by this <hi>our ſeeing him as he is.</hi>

                  <p>Of euery mans purging himſelfe, in whom there is the former hope.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He words remaining are theſe, <hi>Euery one that hath this hope in him, purgeth himſelfe as he is pure.</hi> This (as I ſaid) is an effect of our knowledge of our future likeneſſe vnto Chriſt, (viz. that euery one that ſo certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hopeth for thoſe things, purgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) illuſtrated by the patterne, according to which, euery one that hath the ſaid hope, doth purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Tonching this effect, let this be the firſt obſeruation, that the Apoſtle changeth the former word of knowing, into an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; viz. into hope: what teacheth he thereby? that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer knowledge is but an vncertaine hope? Not ſo: but that this hope is a certaine knowledge: and that therefore it far differeth from the hope of worldly men of their worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: as of the merchant, of the returne of his ſtock with gaine: of the husbandman, of the recouery of his ſeed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, &amp;c. For all ſuch hope, is but vncertaine, depending
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:18428:247"/> vpon many vncertainties. The merchants goods come often hard to the hauens mouth moſt ſafely: and yet euen there, ſhip and all are caſt away. The husbandman hath often good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corne in the blade, and yet by haile, or by cattell, or by ſome other meanes, it is ſmitten, and cleane deſtroied before it come to earing: oftentimes it eareth well, and yet at the time of blowing, it is blaſted, that it neuer ſetteth well: oftentimes it ſetteth well at the firſt, and yet afterward it is ſmitten with mildew, and ſo pinked, that it is little worth. Many times alſo, it ſetteth well at the firſt; thriueth well afterward, continueth well till the very harueſt; and yet then, either by fire from heauen, or by fire through the malice of men (as <hi>Abſolon</hi> fired <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The like may bee ſaid of the hope of other things of this life. All is vncertaine, and nothing but vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. As <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Vanitie of vanities: vanity of vanities: and all is vanity: Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 2. ſo may I ſay, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ncertainty of vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties: vncertainty of vncertainties: and all is vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this hope of the children of God, is ioined with certain knowledge: and is the expectation of thoſe things, which we know moſt certainly: and for which we haue Gods promiſe confirmed with an oath, and many other aſſurances. But of this, we haue ſpoken ſo largely before in Chap. 14 that we ſhal not need to ſpeake any more in this place. Let the Papiſts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore goe with their vncertainty, and let their life ſtill be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, by vncertainty altogether diſquieted and full of feares: but let vs hold our certainty, and labor daily more and more to increaſe the ſame, by purging euery man himſelfe, as it now followeth to be further conſidered. Thus much for our firſt obſeruation vpon theſe words.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the vniuerſality of this ſentence: <hi>Euery one</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that hath this hope in him, purgeth himſelfe.</hi> He ſpeaketh generally: He exempteth and excepteth none: neither yong nor old: neither poore, nor rich: neither vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor learned: neither baſe, nor noble: neither woman, nor man: neither him that is in aduerſity, nor him that is in moſt proſperity: neither ſubiect, nor King. Whoſoeuer he be that
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:18428:247"/> hath this hope, purgeth himſelfe: whoſoeuer he be that hath not this hope, doth not purge himſelfe, neither can purge himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The grace of God, that bringeth ſaluation vnto all men</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>hath appeared, and teacheth vs to deny all vngodlineſſe, and worldly luſts, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo <hi>to looke for the bleſſed hope, &amp;c. Tit.</hi> 2. 11. 12. 13. Marke here, firſt he ſaith, that the Goſpell deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <hi>to be the grace of God</hi> (becauſe it commeth from the free grace and fauor of God; teacheth the free grace and fauor of God; and is the meanes, whereby we both know the free grace and fauor of God, and are alſo partaker thereof, or be brought thereinto) <hi>doth bring ſaluation to all men</hi> (that is, to all ſorts of men; yong and old, maſters and ſeruants, &amp;c. mentioned in the former part of the Chapter) and that then hee ſaith, the ſaid Goſpell or free grace of God <hi>doth teach vs to deny all vngodlines and worldly luſts, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo <hi>to looke for the bleſſed hope, &amp;c.</hi> who then are to deny all vngodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and to looke for the bleſſed hope? Euen all ſorts of men; becauſe the Goſpell bringeth ſaluation vnto all men, and teacheth as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to deny all vngodlineſſe and worldly luſts, &amp;c. and to look for the bleſſed hope, &amp;c. as it bringeth ſaluation vnto. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſo to deny all vngodlineſſe and worldly luſts, &amp;c. is a part and the firſt degree of ſaluation: without which it is not poſſible, to haue the other degrees of ſaluation. A man may be maſter in the arts in the Vniuerſity, that was neuer bacheler in the arts: yea, a man may be bacheler in diuinity, that neuer had any of the former degrees: but no man can haue ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the world to come, that is not commenced, and hath not taken the firſt degree of ſaluation in this world, for the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all vngodlineſſe and worldly luſts, &amp;c. yea, no man can look for that bleſſed hope, which hath not firſt denied all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines. No no, what is that <hi>to deny all godlineſſe, and worldlie luſts, &amp;c.</hi> but to purge himſelfe, as here the Apoſtle ſpeaketh? And what is that, <hi>to looke for the bleſſed hope, &amp;c.</hi> but to haue that hope in him, wherof the Apoſtle here alſo ſpeaketh? I conclude therfore from the former place, the ſame which here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſetteth down, viz. that as all muſt deny all vngodlines and worldly luſt that looke for ſaluation by the grace of God, ſo
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:18428:248"/> all muſt looke for ſaluation, and for that bleſſed hope there ſpoken of, that doe deny all vngodlineſſe, and worldly luſts: and conuerſiuely, that all that doe looke for that bleſſed hope, muſt alſo deny all vngodlineſſe, and worldly luſts: that is, that <hi>euery one that hath this hope in him,</hi> (as this Apoſtle ſpeaketh) <hi>muſt purge himſelfe.</hi> This is the ſecond obſeruation.</p>
               <p>The third is, that he ſpeaketh of that hope that is in a man. He ſaith not, <hi>Euery one that maketh profeſſion of this hope,</hi> or that <hi>hath this hope in his mouth or in his tongue:</hi> but he ſaith, <hi>Euery one that hath this hope in him,</hi> that is, within him in his heart. Many that make profeſſion of this hope, and that ſay, they hope and looke to be ſaued, and <hi>to be made like vnto Chriſt at his appearing,</hi> as well as the beſt, doe notwithſtanding liue in their ſinnes, and not purge themſelues: yea, many doe <hi>declare Gods ordinance to other, and doe talke of the couenant of God. which yet hate to be reformed, and caſt his words behind them,</hi> whereby they ſhould be reformed and purged: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50 16. 17. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh not of ſuch, but of them that indeed haue this hope in them: which is a vertue of the inner man, as well as the other two, <hi>faith and loue,</hi> wherewith it is ioined: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let vs obſerue the word <hi>purgeth,</hi> and that in a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſpect: firſt as touching the ſignification thereof: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as touching the tence whereof it is: viz. of the preſent tence.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt, this word is deriued of a word, that moſt properly ſignifieth chaſte; as the Apoſtle would haue the yonger women to be chaſt: <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 5. Notwithſtanding by the figure <hi>ſynecdoche</hi> (that putteth the ſpeciall for the general) this word is vſed for all vertues: and in this very place, here is not only the verbe, but alſo the primitiue whereof it is deriued, in the words following, <hi>as he is pure:</hi> which being ſpoken of Chriſt, noteth all the vertues that were in him: euen his perfect holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, without any ſinne at all. This verbe in the generall ſignification thereof, is borrowed (as now it is vſed) from the manner of the law for purifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues according to the ceremonies of the law: either after they had any waies defiled themſelues: or before they were to come to the paſſeouer, or to be imploied in any other holy
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:18428:248"/> worke. So it is vſed: <hi>Iohn. 11. 55. Acts</hi> 21. 24. and 24. 18.</p>
               <p>The law being abrogated, when the Apoſtle wrote this, it cannot be taken for any ceremoniall purging, but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall purging from ſinne. So alſo it is taken: <hi>Iames 48. Clenſe your hands ye ſinners, and purge your hearts ye wauering minded men.</hi> So alſo 1. <hi>Pet. 1. 22. Seeing your ſoules are purified in obeying the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This word therefore in this ſignification of it, noteth all ſinne to be a filthy thing: and not only adultery, fornication, and other ſuch bodily vncleannes, (which euery man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth filthy) to be filthy: but euery other ſinne alſo. The wicked do account of ſome ſinnes as ſpeciall ornaments. <hi>Pride is vnto them as a cbaine: and cruelty as a garment: Pſal.</hi> 73. 6. So we ſee, that many in theſe daies, thinke themſelues the trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the gaier, for going in ſtrange apparell, fet from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countries, and contrary to their ſexe (the man wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring womans apparell, eſpecially the woman wearing mans apparrell) and contrary to their kind men and women con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming themſelues rather to beaſts then to any ſobrietie: and the men wearing long haire, euen long locks behind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nature; and not only like to women, but alſo like to ſome vnreaſonable creatures: and women wearing ſuch kindes of periwigs, that if a man ſhould come out of the land of the liuing, where he had not ſeene any ſuch thing, hee would hardly know what kind of creatures they bee, but would take them to be ſome ſtrange monſters, only bred in this country.</p>
               <p>Theſe things haue beene proued before to be condemned in the word, and to be greeuous ſinnes: yet in theſe things, diuers take a great pride, eſteeming of them as of goodly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments: yea, ſo farre are ſome gone in impiety, that they thinke it a great ornament <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o ſweare great and fearefull othes: and that they doe not account of him for a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but rather for a clowne and a foole, that cannot and doth not ordinarily in his common ſpeech, moſt wickedly and prophanely rap out all manner of othes. The like doe ſome account of that foule, and more then beaſtly ſinne of
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:18428:249"/> drunkenneſſe. But howſoeuer theſe and other the like ſinnes be accounted as ornaments, yet the holy Ghoſt doth account them as foule things: and doth often call all ſinne by the name of <hi>filthineſſe: 2. Cor. 7. 1. Iames</hi> 1. 21. or <hi>of uncleanneſſe: Rom</hi> 1. 24. and 6. 19. 2. <hi>pet</hi> 2. 10.</p>
               <p>And it is not to be neglected, that in cuery one of theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there is in the originall a ſeuerall word: though they be all interpreted, either <hi>filthineſſe</hi> or <hi>vncleanneſſe.</hi> For 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. is one word, <hi>Ian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es</hi> 1. 21. another: the primatiue whereof ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth moſt properly ſuch filthineſſe as is gathered in the top of the fingers, betwixt the nailes and the fleſh: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 24. and 6. 19. is another word: and another in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10. what doth all this variety of words teach vs? Truly this, that ſuch is the foulneſſe, and filthineſſe of all ſinne, that no one word is ſufficient to expreſſe or ſet forth the ſame. Let men therefore pleaſe themſelues as much as they will in it; it is but a foule and filthy thing: yea, ſo foule, filthy, and lothſome, that they that hauing been deliuered from it, do returne againe vnto it, are compared to <hi>the dog that returneth to his vemit: and to the ſow, that being waſhed, doth</hi> alſo returne <hi>to her mire</hi> againe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in before ſhe had wallowed: 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. Can any thing be more lothſome then ſuch mire, and then the vomit of a dog? Let no man blame me for writing ſo homely. I vſe the words and phraſe of the Apoſtle: yea, it is the cloquence of moſt wiſe King <hi>Salemon, Pro.</hi> 26. 11. and in both places of the holy ghoſt himſelfe, to make all ſinne the more odious vnto all men.

                  </gap> that for rudeneſſe, and thinke much to heare it ſpoken, which that great and mighty King <hi>Salomen,</hi> and God himſelfe haue vſed for eloquence? Is it not much more ſtrange, that men (euen of the greateſt ſort) ſhould daily defile themſelues with that, and tumble and wallow in it ouer head and cares, ſoule and body, which is a thouſand times more filthy and beaſtly, then either the mire of a ſow, or the vomit of a dog? and reproue thoſe that ſet forth ſuch filthineſſe by the words of King <hi>Salomen,</hi> of the Apoſtle, and of the holy ghoſt? Thus much touching the firſt reſpect of my obſeruation of this word; viz. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:18428:249"/> the ſignification thereof.</p>
               <p>Touching the tence, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not in the time paſt, or in the time to come, ſaying either <hi>he hath purged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi> or <hi>he will purge himſelfe:</hi> but in the time preſent, ſaying, <hi>purgeth,</hi> or <hi>doth purge.</hi> This teacheth that this is, and muſt be a continuall worke: becauſe ſinne, whereof this purging is, doth alwaies remaine, touching the blot, ſtame, and blemiſh thereof. Though they that once be regenerated to be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, be iuſtiſied and diſcharged from the guilt of all their ſinnes: as alſo freed from the bondage of them, yet tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſtaine of ſinne, that doth and ſhall alwaies remaine, as along as we be clothed with corruption. <hi>For who can ſay, I haue made my heart cleane? I am cleane from my ſinne? Pro. 20. 9. There is no man that ſinneth not: 1. Kings 8. 46. In many things we ſinne all: Iames</hi> 3. 2. And who needeth not daily to pray <hi>for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of treſpaſſes? What man alſo lineth, and ſhall not ſee death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are certaine times of the yeere, fitter for purging of the body for bodily health, then other: as the ſpring is beſt of all: and the fall of the leaſe next to that. So alſo in thoſe times that are ſit, there are ſome daies fitter to purge, either with pilles, or with potions, or by vomits, or by clyſters, or by letting of bloud. But for this ſpirituall purging of our ſelues from ſinne, all times are like: all daies ahke: none bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then other: except only, when there is fitter opportunity in reſpect of fitter meanes, as alſo in reſpect of ſome iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and calamity, either generall or ſpeciall, whereby the Lord calleth vs <hi>to ſearch and try our waies, and to turne vnto him: Lam. 3. 40. Ioel</hi> 2. 12. that is, to purge our ſelues of ſuch things as wherewith we haue before defiled our ſelues: and prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Lords wrath againſt vs. This obſeruation, in one word plainly condemneth the ſuperſtition of the Papiſts, that are very preciſe in purging themſelues in the time of Lent, and in abſtaining then from ſuch things, as they fooliſhly thinke will defile themſelues; yea, from the ſtate of mariage, which God himſelfe hath pronounced honorable, without any exceoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of time to the contrary: as alſo at ſome other times of the yeare, which they as vnwiſely imagine to be more holy then
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:18428:250"/> other: whereas at other times, they are altogether ſecure, careleſſe, and licentious: in hope at the returne of the foreſaid holy time and times, to purge and clenſe themſelues once for all. Thus much touching the fourth obſeruation, of the word <hi>purgeth,</hi> in reſpect both of the ſignification, and alſo of the preſent tenſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, let vs obſerue the next word, <hi>himſelfe.</hi> This teacheth, that <hi>he that hath this hope in him,</hi> is not onely curious in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging other, and in teaching and admoniſhing other how they ſhould be purged: but that eſpecially he laboreth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe, and with himſelfe, for the purging of himſelfe. So <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth the Coloſſians, <hi>to teach and admoniſh their owne ſelues: Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 16. and <hi>Iude</hi> them to whom hee did write, <hi>to ediſie themſelues in their moſt holy faith: and to keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the loue of God: Iude</hi> 21. So <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to <hi>Timoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, Study to ſhew thy ſelfe approued vnto God: 2. Tim.</hi> 2. 15. He would not haue him to ſtudie onely for the good of other, but alſo, and in the firſt place for his owne good: that ſo hee might bee the fitter and more able to doe good vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>This is a neceſſary point; becauſe many are very curious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout other, that doe altogether neglect themſelues. They reprooae other: they cenſure other: they teach other, &amp;c. but touching themſelues they are altogether careleſſe: by which meanes they doe theleſſe good vnto other. For who will not be ready to ſay vnto ſuch, <hi>Phyſitian, heale thy ſelfe: Luk</hi> 423. and, <hi>Thou which teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelfe? &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 2. 21. Truly there is nothing that in all ages hath more hindred, and now doth more hinder, the publike miniſtery of the word, and the priuat profeſſion and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (&amp;c.) of others, then the practiſe that hath been and is contrary to ſuch publike teaching, and to ſuch priuat profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and exhortations.</p>
               <p>But what doth the Apoſtle meane by this kind of ſpeech, <hi>Euery one that hath this hope in him purgeth himſelfe?</hi> doth hee teach freewill: and that euery one that hopeth at the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Chriſt to be like vnto Chriſt, hath power to purge himſelfe? Nothing leſſe. The Rhemiſts indeed, and other
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:18428:250"/> Papiſts, vpon this place gather, and inferre that doctrine. But they gather that which is not ſowen: and they inferre concluſions without premiſes: The holy Ghoſt teacheth no ſuch thing, either here, or any where els: yea, he teacheth the cleane contrary. For we haue plentifully heard before, that our whole regeneration is the worke of GOD. To purge our ſelues, is an effect of our regeneration: therefore to purge our ſelues, is likewiſe the worke of God. To purge our ſelues and to ſanctifie our ſelues is all one: but ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is the worke of God onely, (as before alſo hath beene ſhewed) and as appeareth, by the prayer of Chriſt generallie for the Church: <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 17. and of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle particularlie for the <hi>Theſſalonians: 1. Theſſalonians</hi> 5. 23.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour alſo expreſſelie aſcribeth this word of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to his Father, ſaying, <hi>Euerie plant that bringeth foorth fruit, hee</hi> (that is, God the Father) <hi>purgeth, that it may bring foorth more fruit: Iohn</hi> 15. 2. Where it is to be obſerued, that he ſpeaketh not of purging men at the firſt, which are not engraffed into Chriſt, that they may bring foorth the firſt fruits of righteouſneſſe: but that he ſpeaketh of them that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie are ingraffed into Chriſt, and ſaith, that <hi>his Father purgeth them, that they may bring foorth more fruit.</hi> In the ſame place alſo hee ſaith, that without himſelfe (as hee was the mediator God and man) euen <hi>ſuch</hi> (ſo ingraffed into him) can doe nothing; <hi>without mee</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>yee can doe nothing:</hi> verſe 5. If ſuch as the diſciples of Chriſt were, ſo long ingraffed into him, ſo long inſtructed by him, and ſo well acquainted with all his doctrine, miracles, and whole conuerſation, could doe nothing without Chriſt, how much leſſe can any other doe any thing? But what then is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle? Euen this: firſt (as I ſaid before) that <hi>eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one that hath that hope</hi> (already ſpoken of) doth moſt of all buſie himſelfe in this worke of purging, about himſelfe: and not altogether imploie his time about other. It is true in deed, that euery one that hath that hope, doth regard alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (vnder his gouernment eſpecially) and according to his place doth labor the purging of other, that are ſo committed
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:18428:251"/> to his charge. And certainly hee that doth not ſo regard o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath neuer been purged himſelfe: For indeed ſo to doe, is in ſome ſort to purge himſelfe: becauſe euery gouernour being in ſome ſort the head of thoſe to whom he is gouenor: they alſo that are vnder his gouernment, cannot but in like ſort be his members: at leaſt members of that body, whereof he is the head. Euery gouernor of a family, being (as he is the gouernor) the head alſo of the family, all the reſt of the ſame fam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly, are (as it were) his members. Eſpecially as the husband is called <hi>the head of the wife: 1. Cor.</hi> 11. 3. ſo the wife is ſaid to be <hi>bone of his bones, and fleſh of his fleſh: Geneſ.</hi> 2. 23. The children likewiſe are branches, (and ſo in like manner members) of the parents, as being taken out of their loines. So in like manner, the King, or any other hauing kingly and ſupreme and ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne authority, is in that reſpect the head of his people; and his people are in the ſame reſpect his members. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ſuch doe not labour to purge thoſe that doe ſo belong vnto them (euen as <hi>Iob</hi> is ſaid to haue <hi>ſanctified his children: Iob</hi> 1. 5. and as <hi>Abraham</hi> is commended by God himſelfe, that <hi>he would command his ſonnes and his houſhold after him, to keepe the waie of the Lord, &amp;c. Geneſ</hi> 18. 19) if (I ſay) ſuch as are in any authority ouer other doe not labour ſo to purge them that are vnder their gouernment, they may in ſome ſort be ſaid, not to purge themſelues. Notwithſtanding all ſuch doe firſt of all, and muſt firſt of all looke to themſelues, euen to their owne perſons: becauſe otherwiſe their care for other, ſhall either be altogether in vaine, or els it ſhall bee with little ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for further anſwer touching the meaning of theſe words, the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh of thoſe, that already had this hope in them: and which were therfore already ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and in whom Chriſt did dwell by faith. In this reſpect therfore, he might the better ſay, that <hi>euery one that had that hope in him, did purge himſelfe, as Chriſt</hi> himſelfe <hi>is pure:</hi> becauſe ſuch an one being vnited to Chriſt, &amp; Chriſt being made one with him, and he with Chriſt, whatſoeuer Chriſt doth in him, the ſame by the communion betwixt Chriſt and him, is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted as well to him, as to Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="477" facs="tcp:18428:251"/>
               <p>As by the communion betwixt the two natures in Chriſt (the diuine, and the humane) that is often attributed to the one that belongeth to the other: and that is ſaid of the whole perſon that is proper to one nature: viz. that to the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which belongeth to the humane: <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1 1. and that to the humane which is proper to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine: <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 13. and that of whole Chriſt which is proper ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the humanity only: <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 32. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2 52. and 24. 39. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6 38. and 8. 50. and 14. 10. or to the diuinity only: <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 58. and 17. 5. <hi>Coloſſ</hi> 1. 15 as (I ſay) it is thus in Chriſt by the communion betwixt his two natures, ſo by that communion that is betwixt Chriſt and euery ſuch child of God as before I haue ſpoken of, that is ſometime attributed to the child of God himſelfe, that is proper only to Chriſt, and which is the only worke of Chriſt: and that which belongeth to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, is ſpoken of Chriſt, and attributed vnto Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As Chriſt himſelfe is ſaid to ſuffer perſecution when the children of God are perſecuted: <hi>Acts</hi> 94. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 24. becauſe they are his members, although Chriſt in his owne perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in heauen ſuffereth nothing but is out of all danger of perſecution: <hi>Rom.</hi> 69. ſo euery child of God, that hath that hope in him before ſpoken of, is ſaid to purge himſelfe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this worke of purging, or clenſing, or ſanctifying be only the worke of Chriſt himſelfe.</p>
               <p>As the Apoſtle ſpeaking of himſelfe as he was regenerated; and of ſinne remaining in him, ſaith, that it <hi>was no more he that did euill</hi> (viz. as he was a regenerate man, according to that of the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn, He that is borne of God, ſinneth not)</hi> but <hi>that it was ſinne that dwelled in him: Rom.</hi> 9. 17. and 20. ſo he ſpeaking of his labouring for the purging of other (which was alſo one particular point of the purging himſelfe) he ſaith, that <hi>he labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more abundantly then they all:</hi> but preſently he addeth this correction, <hi>yet not I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but the grace of God which is with me. 1. Cor.</hi> 15. 10. In like manner, though the Apoſtle here ſpeaking of the children of God by regeneration ſaith, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of them purgeth himſelfe: yet if he ſhould ſpeake of
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:18428:252"/> ſuch, as they are ſtill in part naturall men, and vnregenerate (or at leaſt vnſanctified) hee would ſay, that ſuch doe not purge themſelues, but that it is Chriſt which dwelleth in them that doth purge them, or the <hi>grace of God that is with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, for further anſwer of the former queſtion, and for a morefull opening of the Apoſtles meaning of theſe words, as <hi>Iob</hi> is ſaid <hi>to haue ſanctified his children</hi> (as before we heard) becauſe he exhorted them to ſanctification, praied and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red other ſacrifices according to thoſe times for their ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and vſed all other meanes that they might be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; ſo the Apoſtle ſaith here, that <hi>euery one that hath this hope in him purgeth himſelfe,</hi> becauſe euery one that hath this hope, will and doth vſe all meanes for the purging of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>What are theſe meanes?

               <p>Becauſe (I ſay) euery <hi>one that hath that hope in him</hi> will and doth vſe all thoſe foreſaid meanes of ſanctification, and ſhunne and auoide all meanes of pollution and of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, therefore alſo doth the Apoſtle ſay in this place, that <hi>eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch one doth purge himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that euery one that hath this <hi>hope,</hi> doth thus purge himſelfe, it is euident, becauſe hope can not be ſeparated from faith. Where there is hope, there alſo is faith, <hi>where by the heart is purified: Acts</hi> 15. 9. as by which Chriſt himſelfe dwelleth in our hearts (as we haue heard) <hi>who hath his fanne in his hand, to pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Cor.</hi> 7. 1.</p>
               <p>Chriſt alſo being the head, and they that haue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hope being the members, as the naturall head commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth vertue to euery naturall member, ſo it cannot be, but that Chriſt will communicate his vertue of purging to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery member of his myſticall body.</p>
               <p>The like is to be ſaid of him as he is the root, and they that haue the foreſaid hope are boughs and branches comming out of the ſaid root. For <hi>if the root be holy, the branches alſo are holy: Rom.</hi> 11. 16.</p>
               <p>This purging muſt not bee only of one part, neither of the body only, nor of the ſoule only; nor of one power of the ſoule, nor of one member of the body: but of both and of all; of ſoule and body: and of euery power of the one, and of euery member of the other. All is comprehended in the word <hi>himſelfe.</hi> Hither belong the places before alledged: 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 8. and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <pb n="480" facs="tcp:18428:253"/>
               <p>Neither muſt this purging be of ſome things onely, but of euery euill. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Iames.</hi> 1. 21. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of conforming our ſelues to euery good worke, and to all that God requireth of euery one, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he is a Chriſtian, or is of any ſpeciall calling. God wil not haue ſome ſinnes onely purged, but all. God wil not haue ſome good dueties performed, but all. Theſe things are common, and haue beene partly handled before. Therefore I doe but name them.</p>
               <p>This alſo (as hath beene noted before) muſt be a daily work, 1. Becauſe there is alwaies ſome ſinne remaining of the old ſtore, which needeth daily purging. 2. Becauſe as the nailes of our hands, though neuer ſo well clenſed one day, doe yet ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch new filth, that they haue neede of new clenſing the next day: ſo it is with vs; we daily ſo gather corruption, that we haue need daily to purge ourſelues.</p>
               <p>Our whole hands and face alſo need daily waſhing: yea, the more they are vſed in any buſines, the oftener they neede to be waſhed. So is it with our linnen for often waſhing: and with our woollen apparell for often bruſhing, according to our often wearing of one or of the other. Our houſes likewiſe muſt be the oftner ſwept, not in the weeke only, but alſo eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, the more, that they are vſed. The like is to bee ſaid of any veſſell that wee occupy, touching ſcouring and other clenſing thereof. As it is with theſe things, ſo is it with vs, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the cleanſing and purging of our whole man from ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall vncleanneſſe.</p>
               <p>As alſo our bodies (for the better preſeruation of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily health) need the oftener to be purged, the corrupter the aire is where we doe liue: likewiſe our ſoules and whole man, (for the better preſeruing of ſpirituall health) are the oftner to be purged, becauſe generally the aire of this neather world where we do liue, is very corrupt and infectious, ſithence the firſt fall of mankind, whereby not onely the breath (as it were) of all men is putrified and made infectious, but alſo all other creatures likewiſe, are in ſome ſort defiled, and made the more dangerous and pernicious vnto vs.</p>
               <p>The more likewiſe that men liue with ſicke perſons, ſicke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:18428:253"/> of ſome infectious and contagious diſeaſe, the more needfull it is for them, not onely to take daily preſeruatiues, but alſo ſome daily purge (mithridate or ſuch like) to expell whatſoeuer noiſome breath they haue receiued from them with whom they do liue. The like is neceſſary (in this worke of purging) for all men, according to the company with who they haue to deale: namely, that the more they conuerſe with the wicked, the more carefull they bee, not onely to carry about them continually the better preſeruatiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſpirituall infections (viz. the more knowledge of the word, which as a precious ſauour they may often ſmell vnto: and the more watchfull eie ouer all their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, and alwaies be the more in all priuate meditation and in priuate praier, &amp;c) but alſo to take daily ſome ſpirituall purge, by examining their daily conuerſation by the word, by praying both forgiueneſſe and alſo reformation of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer where with they haue beene ouertaken contrary to the word, that ſo they may the better expell whatſoeuer ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all infection they haue any waies taken.</p>
               <p>This world generally is like a flax-dreſſers ſhop, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch houſe, where it cannot be but any man ſhall receiue ſome ſoile. In this reſpect therefore the children of God need daily the more carefully to bruſh (as it were) the garments of their Chriſtian profeſſion, the more that they are conuerſant in the world, and deale with worldly affaires.</p>

               <p>The Apoſtle hauing commended the goodnes of God (2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.) in promiſing <hi>to dwell with men, and to be their God, and
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:18428:254"/> their father, and to make them his people, and his ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> he beginneth the ſeuenth Chapter, with an exhortation to this <hi>purging of our ſelues,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Seing then we haue theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, deerly beloued, let vs clenſe our ſelues from all filthneſſe of the fleſh, and of the ſpirit, and finiſh our ſaluation in the feare of God.</hi> So he teacheth all that hope for the performance of the former promiſes, with the appurtenances of them, to purge themſelues in that manner, euen <hi>from all filthineſſe of the fleſh, and of the ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the Philippians alſo he ioineth theſe two together, viz. <hi>to haue our conuerſation in heauen,</hi> (that is, to purge our ſelues as here the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, from all earthly corruption, and to liue after an heauenly manner) <hi>and from heauen to looke likewiſe for the Sauiour, euen our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: Philip.</hi> 3. 20. 21. So he teacheth vs, that whoſoeuer <hi>doe looke for the Lord Ieſus Chriſt from heauen, to change their vile body, and to make it like to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body</hi> (according to that which our Apoſtle hath before written) do alſo behaue themſelues here in earth, after the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid heauenly manner.</p>

Cor. 15. 58. Here the firſt word, <hi>therefore,</hi> ſecretly inſinuateth, and the laſt ſentence added for confirmation plainly expreſſeth this hope, that hither to we haue ſpoken of: and the exhortation it ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both inſerted, doth as euidently intimate this purging of our ſelues (in regard of that hope) which here alſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle commendeth.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not neede to enlarge this point any further. Onely let vs conſider thereof by this familiar ſimilitude, that euery one prepareth himſelfe, and houſe and all, according to the perſon whom he looketh for. What ſeruant that is in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall expectation of his maſters returne home, but will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe and all things belonging vnto him according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? what meane man looketh for the comming of a Noble man: eſpecialle, what ſubiect looketh for the comming of his Prince, but that hee will prepare himſelfe for apparell and for all other things beſeeming the entertainement of ſuch a perſon? Shall wee then looke for the appearing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and at his appearing to be made like vnto him, and ſo to ſee him in all his glory and maieſtie, and ſhall we not purge our ſelues and caſt away al filthines of the fleſh, &amp; of the ſpirit, and put on the robes of he lines and righteouſnes, that ſo
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:18428:255"/> we may be the fitter to intertain him, and to be intertained of him into his glory?</p>
               <p>Let no man deceiue vs with vaine words, neither let vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue our ſelues. It is not poſſible for vs to haue this hope, and to looke for theſe things, but that wee will thus purge our ſelues. If we do not thus purge our ſelues, then certainly wee haue not this hope: neither do we look to be made like vnto Chriſt Ieſus at his appearing, and to ſee him as he is. Would we be like vnto him in glory, and will we not be like vnto him in holineſſe? Would we ſee him as he is now in heauen with our bodily eies, and will we not ſee him as he offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be ſeene in earth, in his word and ſacraments, with the eies of our mind, and by faith? Let vs remember and let vs not forget what the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>follow peace and holineſſe, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord: Heb.</hi> 12. 14. Yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let vs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart for they ſhall ſee God: Mat.</hi> 5. 8. For doe not theſe ſentences plainly ſhew, that without the former holineſſe and purity of heart, none ſhall ſee the Lord? But ſith many things before ſpoken may be referred to this argument, I will therefore inſiſt no longer thereupon.</p>
               <p>If we doe thus purge our ſelues as heere the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, then let vs aſſure our ſelues, that our hope of being made like vnto him, and ſeeing him as he is; ſhall not by any thing whatſoeuer be fruſtrated. Earthly Princes may ſhake vs out of their Courts, <hi>as Mordecai might not enter within King Ahaſhueroſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But in what meaſure muſt <hi>euery one that hath this hope in him purge himſelfe?</hi> Firſt, according to his meaſure of the ſaid hope.
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:18428:255"/> For this purging being an effect of that hope, it cannot bee, but that the more the hope is, the more he that hath that hope will purge himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, according to the meanes before mentioned of purging himſelfe: viz. according to his hearing, reading of the word, meditation, company of the godly, praiers &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For all theſe meanes being the ordinances of God for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to purge himſelfe, it cannot bee but that the more any man doth in truth vſe the ſaid meanes, the more bleſſing God will giue vnto them for effecting this purging.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, according to other meanes that God himſelfe doth vſe towards them that haue the ſaid hope for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of them, viz. according to the mercies which he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon them, and according to the chaſtiſements wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he doth exerciſe them. For theſe doth the Lord vſe (as before hath beene mentioned) to kill the weedes of ſinne in men, and to make them the more plentifull in the fruits of righteouſnes. What is this but to purge them as here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh, and as our Sauiour himſelf ſpeaketh in the very ſame caſe? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 2.</p>
               <p>Gods mercies are (as it were) the marling and manuring, or (to ſpeake more plainely) as the mucking and dunging of our barren hearts: and Gods chaſtiſements and corrections, are as it were the ploughing of them, after they are ſo marled, manured, mucked and dunged: or as the harrowing of them to breake their hard clods: and both are to make them the more fruitfull in all goodnes.</p>
               <p>As men therefore doe looke that their grounds ſhould bee the more freed from weedes, and bring forth the better crops of good corne, the more they dung, plough, and harrow them; ſo the more that God doth multiply his mercies vpon his children, and exerciſe them with his corrections, the more he looketh they ſhould be purged of ſinne, and bring forth the fruits of righteouſnes.</p>

                  </gap>uery child of God is to purge himſelfe, and to be ſo much the more holy, by how much the more impure, filthy &amp; vnholy he ſeeth other to be. Therfore the holy ghoſt by the examples of ſuch as haue been idolaters, fornicators, tempters of God, murmurers, prophane perſons, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wicked, doth prouoke the children of God, the more to take heed of ſuch ſinnes: and the more to abound in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vertues: 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 6. 7 &amp;c. Heb. 12. 16 17. Iude</hi> 3. and 4. and 20. This is neceſſary, firſt in reſpect of God, that the more he is diſhonored by other, the more glory he may haue by his children. Secondly, in reſpect of ſuch wicked men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, for their better conuerſion: <hi>Mat. 5. 16. 1 Pet.</hi> 2 12.</p>
               <p>The like is to bee ſaid of purging our ſelues according to the care that we ſee of other for purging themſelues. The more we ſee other to purge themſelues, the more alſo muſt we purge our ſelues. Therefore doth God let vs ſee and heare of good examples, that we ſhould imitate them: <hi>Heb. 13. 8.

               <p>Laſt of all, the more vncleane and polluted that wee our ſelues haue been, the more <hi>we haue giuen our members as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants vnto vncleanneſſe and to iniquity,</hi> before we had this hope in vs. the more the Lord doth require that we ſhould <hi>giue our m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this is plaine by the doctrine of our Sauiour himſelfe. For from the particular experience of the abundant loue of the woman towards him, that had found abundant mercy in the forgiueneſſe of her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant ſinnes: from (I ſay) his particular experience of her abundant loue, for his abundant mercy in forgiuing her abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſinnes, teſtified by abundant fruits thereof: viz. firſt by her <hi>bringing a box of pretious ointment:</hi> Secondly, <hi>by her waſhing Chriſts feet with her teares:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>by her wiping them with the hair of her head:</hi> Fourthly, <hi>by her kiſſing of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Fiftly, <hi>by her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing them with the foreſaid ointment</hi> (that ſo they might not
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:18428:256"/> bee cleane with her waſhing, but alſo ſweete with her oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) by all theſe things our Sauiour pronounceth, that <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinnes were forgiuen her:</hi> and from all theſe things in her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular example, he inſinuateth this generall doctrine, that <hi>to whom much is forgiuen, he loueth much:</hi> as contrarily, <hi>to whom a little is forgiuen, he loueth a little.</hi> Luk. 7. 47.</p>
               <p>This we haue ſeene by the example of <hi>Peter</hi> before. The more he had fallen and defiled himſelfe by denying and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing of Chriſt, the more Chriſt afterward chargeth him to loue him, and to declare his loue by feeding his ſheepe the more diligently. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. 15. yea, before this charge, the more we haue heard <hi>Peter</hi> to haue teſtified his loue towards Chriſt himſelfe, by caſting himſelfe into the ſea, as ſoone as euer he heard Chriſt to be on the ſhore, and by ſwimming vnto Chriſt when the reſt of the diſciples (euen <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelfe not excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who was the diſciple whom Chriſt had ſpecially loued) made no more haſt, then to come by ſhip vnto him.</p>
               <p>The more that <hi>Paul</hi> before his calling had blaſphemed and perſecuted Chriſt, the more being called he purged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſhewed himſelfe zealous of the glory of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his former blaſphemy: as alſo by more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant labour for the Church: 1. Cor. 15. 10. and 2. Cor. 11. 23. He ſhewed himſelfe the more louing to the Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his former perſecution thereof.</p>
               <p>As the Scripture recordeth <hi>Bathſheba</hi> the wife of <hi>Vriah</hi> to haue been a greater ſinner by yeelding to the adulterous luſt of <hi>Dauid,</hi> then <hi>Abigail:</hi> ſo when they were both the wiues of <hi>Dauid,</hi> it appeareth that ſhe went further in purging of her ſelfe then <hi>Abigail.</hi> This (I ſay) appeareth as by many other teſtimonies of her greater godlines, ſo eſpecially by thoſe gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den precepts of pietie and vertue giuen to her ſonne <hi>Salomon. Pro.</hi> 31. 1. &amp;c. and often elſe where.</p>
               <p>Thus much of this effect of our hope; <hi>viz.</hi> of purging our ſelues.</p>
               <p>The patterne according to which we are to purge our ſelues, is Chriſt himſelf: <hi>as he is pure.</hi> This word <hi>as,</hi> is not a note of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality or parity, but only of ſimilitude or likenes. As at the appearing of Chriſt, we ſhall not be equall vnto him in glory, but only like him: ſo much leſſe in this life can we be equal in
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:18428:257"/> lines, but onely like him. This patterne is the moſt perfect patterne of all other: we are indeede ſometimes exhorted to imitate and to reſemble men; but they are no otherwiſe to be imitated and reſembled, then only as they doe imitate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble Chriſt: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. Therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith not, follow <note place="margin">Note.</note> them which are good. (For euen the beſt haue their faults, wherein they are not to be followed) but he ſaith, <hi>follow that which is good.</hi> 3. Iohn. 11.</p>
               <p>That all that haue the former hope muſt purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, <hi>as he is pure,</hi> it is manifeſt, becauſe we haue heard before, that he is our King. Now wee know and ſee by daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſubiects for the moſt part doe compoſe and frame themſelues according to the example of their Princes. Wee haue likewiſe heard, that Chriſt is the head, we the members: Chriſt is the husband, we the wife: Chriſt is the vine, wee the branches. Muſt we not therefore purge our ſelues, as hee is pure? Are not the members of like nature with the head? Muſt not the wife frame her ſelfe (as neere as can bee) to her husband? And haue not the branches, the ſame vertue and qualities that the vine?</p>
               <p>This condemneth the folly and madnes of the Papiſts that haue ſo many patternes of imitation as they haue orders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</p>
               <p>Some are <hi>Dominicans,</hi> ſome are <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> ſome are <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictines,</hi> ſome are <hi>Auguſtines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some are black Fryars, ſome white, ſome gray. I meruaile alſo they had not ſome tawnie, ſome ruſſet, ſome greene, ſome yellow, ſome blew: ſome of all other colours.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Paul</hi> condemned the Corinthians for holding ſome of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſome of <hi>Apollos,</hi> ſome of <hi>Cephas</hi> ſome of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1. Cor. 1. 12. &amp;c. would he iuſtify the folly and madneſſe of the Papiſts, in their foreſaid multiplying of orders, and in propounding to themſelues ſo many patternes of imitation, ſo different and diuers euery one from another?</p>
               <p>Chriſt is not to be imitated in thoſe things that hee did as God onely: viz. in his miracles, whereby he declared himſelfe to be God: nor in thoſe things which were proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the office of his Mediation: but in thoſe things which
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:18428:257"/> he did in the common forme of a ſeruant. Therefore the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are as fooliſh and mad for imitation of Chriſt in their lent faſt, as they ſhould be, if becauſe he walked on the ſea, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo they ſhould take vpon them to doe the like.</p>
               <p>This patterne is not ſpeciall for ſome, but generall for all the children of God. For the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>euery one that hath this hope in him, purgeth himſelfe, as he is pure.</hi> As therefore not ſome, but <hi>euery one that hath this hope in him, of being like vnto Chriſt in glorie at his appearing, and of ſeeing him as he is, muſt purge himſelfe;</hi> ſo alſo not ſome, <hi>but euery one that hath the ſaid hope, muſt purge himſelfe,</hi> according to this pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne. This therefore eſpecially condemneth that ſtrict ſect of the Papiſts, called Ieſuites: which in a kinde of extreame pride, in name, and in a more preciſe kinde of imitation of Chriſt, as they pretend, do both ſingle themſelues from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and alſo aduance themſelues aboue all other. For doth not the Apoſtle in the place before alledged reprooue the Corinthians, as well for holding ſome of Chriſt in a ſpeciall maner, as for holding ſome of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſome of <hi>Apollos,</hi> ſome of <hi>Cephas?</hi> And doth he not alſo thereby teach, that as albaptized into Chriſt, are Chriſtians alike; ſo all (if any) muſt be alſo Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites alike? Though in Cambridge, Chriſt Colledge, and Ieſus Colledge be two diſtinct colledges, yet in profeſſion the names Chriſt and Ieſus are not ſo to be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point touching this patterne according to which we are to purge our ſelues. Let vs remember what <hi>Iacob</hi> did to haue blacke and white ſpotted lambs, yea, what he did in that behalfe, not of his owne head, but by direction of God himſelfe: as alſo let vs conſider the ſucceſſe thereof.

                  </gap>ing this, it is ſaid, <hi>that Iacob took rods of greene poplar, &amp; of haſell, and of the cheſnut tree, and pilled white ſtrokes in them, and made the white appeare in the rods, and then put the rods which hee had pilled into the gutters and wairing troughs, when the ſheepe came to drinke before the ſheepe, becauſe they were then in heat when they came to drinke.</hi> Wherefore did he all this? Becauſe before he had made a couenant with <hi>Laban</hi> to haue no other wages, then <hi>the party coloured ſheepe with great and little ſpots;</hi> all that were ſo ſpotted before, beeing firſt taken out of the
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:18428:258"/> flocks, and committed to the other ſonnes of <hi>Laban</hi> to bee kept by themſelues three daies iourney from thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the keeping of <hi>Iacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What was the ſucceſſe of this practiſe? It is further ſaide, that <hi>the ſheepe beeing then in heat, (becauſe it was then ramming time) and ſeeing thoſe reds ſo pilled with white ſtrokes lying before them,</hi> by the impreſſion of them (but chieflie by the ſpeciall prouidence of God) <hi>brought foorth yong of partie colour and with ſmall and great ſpots.</hi> Geneſ. 30. 37. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To apply this to our preſent purpoſe, as thoſe ſheepe by beholding thoſe rods ſo pilled with white ſtrokes amongſt the naturall greene that was left on them, through the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all prouidence of God, did bring forth yong partie coloured, like to thoſe ſaid pilled rods in that maner laid before them: ſo if euery one that hath that former hope in him of being at the appearing of Chriſt like vnto him in glorie, and of ſeeing him as hee is, for the purging of himſelfe would alwaies lay before his eies this excellent patterne of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe heere commended vnto vs, and ſeriouſly marke and obſerue the ſame, it could not bee, but that through the gracious working of God, the ſight of this pattern would make ſo deepe an impreſſion in the heart of ſuch a man, that hee ſhould <hi>purge himſelfe as Chriſt is pure:</hi> and bee made like vnto him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, for his better aſſurance of his future likeneſſe vnto him in glory.</p>
               <p>But therefore indeede doe men continue the longer in their ſpirituall filthineſſe, and bee not transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the likeneſſe of Chriſt in the foreſaide holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, becauſe they doe not ſo behold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this excellent patterne, as they ſhould doe. And this is a manifeſt argument, that whatſoeuer ſome men ſpeake of their knowing Chriſt, and of ſeeing Chriſt, as alſo of their hope of beeing made like vnto Chriſt at his appearing as well as any other, yet indeede all theſe are but words, becauſe they doe not purge themſelues as
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:18428:258"/> he is pure. For if they had that hope they ſpeake of, if they did ſo know Chriſt, and behold Chriſt as they boaſt they do, then doubtleſſe they would purge themſelues as he is pure.</p>
               <p>This muſt bee applied to particular vertues, wherein Chriſts puritie doth ſpeciallie conſiſt: as <hi>to walking in loue, as hee hath loued vs: Epheſians 5. 2. To running with patience the race that is ſet before vs: looking vnto Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the author and finiſher of our faith, who for the ioie that was ſet before him, endured the Croſſe and deſpiſed the ſhame: Hebrewes 12. 1. 2. and ſuffered for vs, leauing vs an example, that wee ſhould follow his ſteppes, &amp;c. 1. Pet.</hi> 2. 21. ſo likewiſe to humilitie, <hi>that in meekeneſſe of minde euerie man eſteeme other better then himſelfe: not looking onlie on his owne things</hi> (that is, on his owne gifts, that himſelfe hath receiued) <hi>but alſo on the things of other men: as hauing the ſame mind, that was euen in Chriſt Ieſus; who being in the forme of God, and thinking it no robberie to be equall to God, made himſelfe of no reputation, but tooke on him the forme of a ſeruant, and was made like vnto man, and was found in the ſhape of a man, and humbled himſelfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the Croſſe, &amp;c. Phil. 2. 3. &amp;c.</hi> The like may be ſaid of other ſpeciall vertues, and particular branches, of that puritie that was in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>All theſe things that I haue now written of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the children of GOD, God himſelfe write in the hearts of all, that ſhall read them thus written in paper. And hee that hath loued them with ſuch admirable and incomprehenſible loue, as to aduance them to this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable dignitie, continue this his loue in them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end: and ſo purge and transforme them into the holineſſe of Chriſt Ieſus in this world, that as heereby they doe alreadie know, that howſoeuer they bee heere of the world contemned, and made the off-ſcouring, and (as it were) the skumme of the world, yet at the appearing of Chriſt, they ſhall bee made like vnto him, and ſee him as hee is: ſo indeede they may bee ſo made like vnto him, and ſo ſee him and his glorie, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioie the ſame for euer and euer:</p>
